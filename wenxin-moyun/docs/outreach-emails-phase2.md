Hi LMArena Team,

Congratulations on the $150M Series A - the validation of crowdsourced AI evaluation is exciting to see.

We've built VULCA, a cultural understanding benchmark for Vision-Language Models that could complement your evaluation infrastructure. Given that Arena already tests 60M+ monthly conversations, adding cultural dimension testing could be a natural extension.

What we offer:
- 47 evaluation dimensions across 8 cultural traditions
- 7,410 expert-annotated image-critique pairs (EN/ZH bilingual)
- L1-L5 framework: Visual Perception to Philosophical Aesthetics
- Already benchmarked 42+ frontier models including GPT-4V, Gemini, Claude, Qwen-VL

Our pilot results show consistent Western bias across all major VLMs (15-25% performance gaps) - findings that could enrich Arena's leaderboard with cultural fairness metrics.

Would you be interested in exploring a partnership? Happy to share our methodology and sample evaluation reports.

Dear Prof. Stoica,

I'm reaching out regarding the intersection of AI evaluation and cultural understanding - an area I believe aligns well with LMArena's mission.

We've developed VULCA, a multicultural benchmark for Vision-Language Models that addresses a gap in current evaluation frameworks. Given your work on LMArena and the Chatbot Arena, I thought you might find our approach interesting:

Key contributions:
- 47 culture-specific evaluation dimensions (vs. generic VLM benchmarks)
- Coverage of 8 cultural traditions (Chinese, Western, Japanese, Islamic, etc.)
- L1-L5 hierarchy from visual perception to philosophical aesthetics
- Bilingual framework (EN/ZH) with 7,410 expert-annotated pairs

Our findings reveal consistent Western bias across all tested VLMs - including top performers on Arena leaderboards. This suggests cultural understanding may be an underserved dimension in current evaluation paradigms.

Would you have 15 minutes to discuss potential collaboration? This could range from benchmark validation studies to integration with LMArena's evaluation infrastructure.

Hi Logan,

I saw the WSJ piece on Anthropic's Frontier Red Team work - the focus on catastrophic risk evaluation is fascinating.

I wanted to share VULCA, a cultural understanding benchmark that could complement your red teaming efforts for multimodal models. Cultural misinterpretation may not be "catastrophic" in the traditional sense, but it's a significant source of AI harm in global deployment:

What we've found:
- 15-25% performance gaps between Western and non-Western cultural content
- Consistent symbol misinterpretation (religious, historical, artistic)
- Higher-layer cultural reasoning (L3-L5) significantly harder than visual tasks

Our framework:
- 47 evaluation dimensions across 8 cultural traditions
- 7,410 expert-annotated test cases
- Bilingual coverage (EN/ZH)
- Already tested on Claude, GPT-4V, Gemini, and 39 other models

Given your background at Google X and Oxford ML, I think you'd find our methodology interesting. Would you be open to a brief call to explore how VULCA could inform Anthropic's multimodal safety work?

Hi Mrinank,

Congratulations on launching the Safeguards Research Team and the Constitutional Classifiers work - the focus on jailbreak robustness is exactly what the field needs.

I wanted to introduce VULCA, a cultural understanding benchmark that could complement your safeguards research. We've found that cultural misinterpretation is a significant source of model failure that isn't captured by traditional jailbreak testing:

Key findings:
- VLMs consistently misinterpret cultural symbols (religious, historical, artistic)
- Higher-layer cultural reasoning shows 15-25% performance gaps between cultures
- Cultural bias persists even in "safe" outputs - not a jailbreak, but still problematic

Our framework:
- 47 culture-specific evaluation dimensions
- 8 cultural traditions covered
- 7,410 expert-annotated image-critique pairs
- L1-L5 hierarchy from visual perception to philosophical aesthetics

Given your work on automated red teaming and monitoring, I think VULCA could provide valuable signal for cultural robustness. Would you be interested in exploring collaboration or having us contribute to your evaluation pipeline?

Dear Prof. Fergus,

Congratulations on returning to lead FAIR - the reunion with Yann and the team must be exciting.

I'm reaching out regarding cultural understanding evaluation for VLMs - an area that may be relevant to FAIR's research priorities. We've built VULCA, a benchmark that tests how well vision-language models understand cultural context, symbolism, and aesthetic meaning.

Why this matters for FAIR:
- Llama's global deployment requires cultural robustness
- Our findings show 15-25% performance gaps between Western and non-Western content
- Cultural bias persists across all major VLMs we've tested

Our framework:
- 47 evaluation dimensions across 8 cultural traditions
- 7,410 expert-annotated image-critique pairs
- L1-L5 hierarchy from visual perception to philosophical aesthetics
- Bilingual coverage (EN/ZH)

We've already benchmarked 42+ models including Llama variants. I'd be happy to share our methodology and findings - and explore whether VULCA could inform FAIR's multimodal research.

Would you have time for a brief call?
