## 邮件 1: Ahmad Rushdi - Stanford HAI

**To**: rushdi@stanford.edu
**Subject**: Cultural VLM benchmark - collaboration with Stanford HAI?

```
Hi Ahmad,

I came across Stanford HAI's industry collaboration program and thought VULCA might be a good fit for discussion.

We've built a multicultural evaluation benchmark specifically for Vision-Language Models:

• 47 evaluation dimensions across 8 cultural traditions
• 7,410 expert-annotated image-critique pairs (EN/ZH bilingual)
• L1-L5 framework: Visual Perception → Philosophical Aesthetics
• Already tested on 42+ models including GPT-4V, Gemini, Claude, Qwen-VL

Given HAI's focus on human-centered AI and the 2025 AI Index findings on capability gaps, VULCA could provide valuable cultural understanding metrics for multimodal benchmarking.

Would you have 15 minutes to explore potential collaboration?

## 邮件 2: Glenn Wong - MIT CSAIL (替换 Lori Glover，已离职)

**To**: glennw@mit.edu
**Subject**: Multimodal cultural evaluation benchmark - industry collaboration inquiry

```
Dear Glenn,

I'm reaching out to the CSAIL Alliances team regarding potential industry collaboration. I understand you're leading the global strategic alliances program, and thought VULCA might align well with CSAIL's industry collaboration initiatives.

We've developed VULCA, a benchmark that evaluates how well Vision-Language Models understand cultural context in visual art - an area that complements CSAIL's work on multimodal interpretability (like the recent MAIA project).

Key capabilities:
• 47 culture-specific evaluation dimensions
• Expert-annotated bilingual critiques (7,410 pairs)
• Tested on 42+ frontier models
• Framework spans perception to philosophical aesthetics (L1-L5)

We're interested in exploring:
1. Joint benchmark validation studies
2. Sponsored research pilots
3. Student project collaborations

Would your team be open to a brief introductory call?

## 邮件 3: Prof. Danqi Chen - Princeton NLP

**To**: danqic@cs.princeton.edu
**Subject**: Collaboration opportunity - multicultural VLM evaluation benchmark

```
Dear Prof. Chen,

I came across your CharXiv work on chart understanding in multimodal LLMs, and thought our research directions might align well.

We've developed VULCA-Bench, a multicultural art-critique benchmark that evaluates VLMs' cultural understanding beyond surface-level visual perception. Our framework:

• 47 dimensions across 8 cultural traditions (Chinese, Western, Japanese, etc.)
• 7,410 matched image-critique pairs with expert annotations
• Bilingual coverage (EN/ZH)
• L1-L5 hierarchy: Visual Perception → Philosophical Aesthetics

Our pilot results show that higher-layer cultural reasoning (L3-L5) is consistently more challenging than visual analysis - similar patterns to what you've observed in chart understanding.

I'd love to share a sample evaluation report and discuss potential collaboration - whether for benchmark validation or joint publications.

Would you have 10 minutes for a brief introduction?

**To**: inquiries@promptfoo.dev
**Subject**: Cultural evaluation module for multimodal red teaming

```
Hi Promptfoo Team,

I saw your multimodal red teaming guide and think VULCA could be a valuable addition to your evaluation toolkit.

We've built a specialized cultural understanding benchmark for VLMs that tests:

• Symbolic interpretation (religious, cultural, historical symbols)
• Cross-cultural context understanding
• Aesthetic judgment and critique generation

## 邮件 6: Berkman Klein Center - Harvard

**To**: hello@cyber.harvard.edu
**Subject**: Cultural fairness evaluation for multimodal AI - research collaboration

```
Hello BKC Team,

I'm reaching out regarding the intersection of AI fairness and cultural representation - an area I believe aligns with Berkman Klein's mission.

We've developed VULCA, an evaluation framework that measures how well Vision-Language Models understand and represent diverse cultural perspectives. Our research reveals:

• Consistent Western bias across major VLMs
• Performance gaps of 15-25% between Western and non-Western cultural content
• Higher-layer cultural reasoning (philosophical, aesthetic) is significantly harder than visual perception

Our benchmark covers:
- 8 cultural traditions (Chinese, Western, Japanese, Islamic, etc.)
- 47 evaluation dimensions
- 7,410 expert-annotated image-critique pairs

This could provide concrete, measurable evidence for AI fairness discussions around cultural representation.

Would your team be interested in exploring collaboration opportunities?
