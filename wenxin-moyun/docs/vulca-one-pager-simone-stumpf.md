## What is VULCA?

**VULCA** (Visual Understanding and Linguistic Cultural Assessment) is a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) understand and interpret visual art across diverse cultural contexts.

Our work addresses a critical gap: **current VLM benchmarks largely ignore cultural fairness in visual understanding.** VULCA provides systematic evaluation across 8 cultural perspectives, enabling researchers to identify and audit cross-cultural biases in AI art interpretation.

## Research Foundation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Models evaluated | 42 (from 15 organizations) |
| Evaluation dimensions | 47 fine-grained dimensions |
| Cultural perspectives | 8 (Eastern/Western traditions) |
| Benchmark samples | 7,410 (L1-L5 annotated) |
| Academic venue | **EMNLP 2025 Findings** |

## Relevance to Your Research

### 1. Cross-Cultural AI Fairness
Your **EARN Fairness** framework emphasizes stakeholder negotiation in AI fairness metrics. VULCA extends this to the cultural domain:
- How do different cultural stakeholders perceive "good" art interpretation?
- Which VLMs exhibit Western-centric biases? Which are more culturally inclusive?
- Our 8-perspective framework enables systematic fairness auditing across Chinese literati aesthetics, Japanese mono no aware, European formalism, and more.

### 2. Explainable AI in Visual Understanding
Your foundational work on **Explanatory Debugging** addresses how users understand ML decisions. VULCA provides:
- 47-dimensional breakdown of *why* a model's interpretation succeeds or fails
- Dimension categories: creativity recognition, emotional resonance, cultural symbolism, compositional analysis
- Transparent evaluation data enabling researchers to trace model behavior

### 3. Participatory Harm Auditing (PHAWM)
VULCA-Bench can serve as a **harm auditing tool** for:
- Identifying cultural representation bias in VLMs
- Testing whether models perpetuate Western-centric art discourse
- Involving diverse cultural communities in evaluation (our L1-L5 annotation involves cross-cultural expert review)

---

## Key Findings

1. **Cultural bias is pervasive**: Most leading VLMs score 15-20% lower on non-Western cultural perspectives compared to Western frameworks.

2. **Dimension-specific gaps**: Models often excel at technical analysis (composition, color) but struggle with cultural symbolism and contextual meaning.

3. **Size ≠ fairness**: Larger models don't automatically exhibit better cross-cultural understanding.

## Potential Collaboration Areas

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Fairness auditing** | Using VULCA-Bench to audit VLMs for cultural representation bias |
| **Explanatory evaluation** | Developing XAI methods to explain why models fail on specific cultural dimensions |
| **Participatory methods** | Involving art communities in benchmark development and harm assessment |
| **Debiasing strategies** | Building on your CHI 2025 "Explanatory Debiasing" work for cultural contexts |

## About Me

I'm **Haorui Yu**, a PhD researcher (Year 2) at University of Dundee (DJCAD). My work focuses on cross-cultural VLM evaluation and AI-assisted art interpretation. VULCA represents my primary research contribution, with multiple publications:

- **VULCA Framework** — EMNLP 2025 Findings
- **VULCA-Bench** — arXiv:2601.07986
- **Art Critique Evaluation** — arXiv:2601.07984

I'm exploring collaboration opportunities with researchers in **Responsible AI, XAI, and AI Fairness**—your work at Glasgow is highly relevant to the cultural fairness challenges I'm addressing.
