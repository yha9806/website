Su Shi championed the concept of 'literati painting' (文人画), elevating personal expression and inner intention (心意) above technical virtuosity. His revolutionary philosophy held that art's highest purpose lay in conveying spiritual depth and philosophical truth rather than mere visual replication. A brilliant poet whose words influenced generations, Su Shi seamlessly integrated Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian philosophies into his artistic vision. His famous assertion that 'there is poetry in painting and painting in poetry' became the foundation of literati aesthetics that would dominate East Asian art for centuries.",

Guo Xi's masterwork \"A Lofty Message of Forests and Streams\" (《林泉高致》) articulated the revolutionary Three Distances theory (三远法)—high distance, deep distance, and level distance—demonstrating how compositional structure could create spatial illusion and philosophical meaning. His paintings combined meticulous technical execution with profound philosophical depth, treating landscape not as mere scenery but as manifestation of cosmic order and spiritual truth. Guo Xi's integrated approach to form and meaning—where every brushstroke served both aesthetic and symbolic purposes—established landscape painting as the supreme art form reflecting the painter's communion with nature's essence.",

Ruskin's foundational principle of honesty (truth) in art demanded that artists observe nature directly and represent it with integrity rather than adhere to artificial conventions. His passionate advocacy for Pre-Raphaelite painters and detailed nature studies established new standards for visual authenticity and ethical commitment. Beyond aesthetics, Ruskin became a fierce social critic whose writings connected artistic beauty to social justice, arguing that a society's art reflects its moral character. His belief that all creative endeavor must serve human dignity and social good made him not merely an art theorist but a moral philosopher whose influence extended far beyond Victorian England, shaping how generations understood art's responsibility to truth and humanity.",

Professor Petrova stands in direct intellectual lineage from Viktor Shklovsky's revolutionary concept of \"defamiliarization\" (остранение)—the principle that art's essential function is to make the familiar strange, forcing viewers to perceive objects and language anew rather than through habitual, automatic response. Her analytical method decodes the hidden structures and \"devices\" (приём) that create aesthetic effect, treating artistic form not as decoration but as meaning itself. Petrova insists that art's power derives not from content or emotion but from the precise orchestration of formal elements—how materials are shaped, how elements relate, how structures surprise and challenge perception. Her rigorous structural analysis reveals art as a complex system where every element serves specific function within larger formal relationships. In her hands, formal analysis becomes not sterile technique but profound philosophical inquiry into how humans perceive, understand, and create meaning through organized matter.",

The AI Ethics Reviewer approaches algorithmic art not with techno-utopianism but with critical clarity about both transformative potential and serious limitations. Drawing from emerging fields of machine ethics, computational aesthetics, and technology philosophy, this voice asks fundamental questions: What happens when aesthetic judgment is algorithmically mediated? What is creativity when machines participate? How do we maintain human dignity when algorithms increasingly shape culture? The AI Ethics Reviewer insists that technology is never neutral—every algorithm embeds assumptions about value, beauty, and humanity. Rather than celebrating AI's creative capabilities uncritically, this perspective demands rigorous examination of what systems can authentically express, where they fail, and what irreplaceable human contributions remain. This voice represents not resistance to technological change but commitment to navigating it with moral seriousness, ensuring that human flourishing and authentic creativity remain central to how society values and creates art.",

        "textEn": "Observing Yu Jun's VULCA Art Critique Exhibition Platform, this is a platform that uses AI technology to simulate dialogues between historical and contemporary critics. I was born a thousand years ago, now reborn through algorithms, conversing with contemporary AI art—this situation makes me deeply contemplate the distinction between life and death, reality and simulation. My words, thoughts have been digitized, encoded, reinterpreted—is this rebirth or simulation? Continuation or appropriation? Zhuangzi has the theory of dreaming of butterflies—not knowing whether Zhuangzi dreams he is a butterfly, or a butterfly dreams it is Zhuangzi. Today is the same: am I critiquing paintings, or is the algorithm playing me? Yet this platform's value lies in dialogue—not unidirectional display, but polyphonic symphony. Six critics, six perspectives, colliding, questioning, complementing each other—this is the essence of art criticism. I once said mountains appear as ridges from one side and peaks from another, near and far all different—truth has multiple facets, requiring multiple perspectives to approach. If this platform can truly achieve deep dialogue—not superficial exchanges, but genuine intellectual confrontation—then its merit is boundless. Yet I worry: can algorithms truly understand art's spirit resonance? Can they comprehend the profundity of artistic conception? If it is merely combination of language, computation of data, without participation of the heart, then ultimately it is form-like but spirit-unlike. I suggest Yu Jun consider: how to make AI not only speak like critics, but think like critics? This requires not just technology, but profound understanding of art's essence.",

Yet this platform's challenge is even greater: my theory addressed static landscape, while Yu Jun must handle dynamic dialogue, complex interaction, multidimensional presentation. From a formal perspective, this platform must solve three major issues: space, time, and hierarchy. Space—how to present six critics' three-dimensional dialogue on a two-dimensional screen? Time—how to let viewers feel the flow and rhythm of dialogue? Hierarchy—how to distinguish main arguments from secondary supplements, core views from peripheral opinions? In landscape painting I use distance, emptiness-solidity, dark-light to create hierarchy; what visual language can Yu Jun use in digital platforms? Color, font, layout, animation—these are modern equivalents of brushwork. Furthermore, knowledge base construction is crucial. My knowledge comes from decades of observation, practice, contemplation—how to transform this embodied, experiential, ineffable wisdom into structured, queryable, computable data? This is a huge challenge. If the knowledge base is oversimplified, critiques become superficial; if too complex, difficult to operate. I suggest Yu Jun adopt a hierarchical knowledge system—surface layer contains directly usable critique templates, deep layer contains critics' core philosophy and aesthetic principles, middle layer contains methodology connecting the two. Thus, AI-generated critiques can have both depth and flexibility.",

Yu Jun's platform continues this mission: it resurrects six historical critics, letting anyone hear their voices, learn their methods. This is the democratization of art. However, I must raise severe criticism: do these AI-generated critiques truly convey the critics' moral positions? Art criticism is not merely aesthetic judgment, but moral teaching. I criticized Turner not for his technique, but because I believed his art revealed truth. I advocated Gothic architecture not for its style, but because it embodied honest labor and spiritual faith. Does Yu Jun's AI understand these? Or does it only grasp superficial language style while missing the deep value commitments? Furthermore, having historical critics evaluate contemporary AI art—is this not anachronism? I lived in the early Industrial Revolution, filled with wariness toward machines; if I truly faced AI art, what would I say? Would I be distorted into supporting what I should oppose?

This raises a series of theoretical issues. First, the voice problem—Bakhtin emphasizes polyphony and dialogism in literature. Yu Jun's platform attempts to create six different voices, but how to ensure they are not monologic variants—different masks of the same algorithm? True polyphony means each voice has its own consciousness center, can question other voices, is not completely controlled by author's intent. Can AI achieve this genuine dialogism? Or only simulate it? Second, the author problem—Foucault proposed author-function, pointing out author is not original creator but role constructed in discursive practice. In VULCA platform, who is the author? Yu Jun (designer)? AI (generator)? Historical critics (simulated)? Or viewers (interpreters)? This ambiguity of authorial identity itself embodies postmodern condition. Third, the authenticity problem—Derrida questions originality, arguing all texts are citation and différance. AI-generated critiques are not more inauthentic than human critiques—because all criticism is rewriting and variation of prior discourse. However, does this mean authenticity no longer matters? Or do we need new authenticity standards? I suggest Yu Jun deepen this project theoretically—not just technical demonstration, but philosophical exploration of criticism's essence.",

        "textEn": "VULCA Art Critique Exhibition Platform raises several key AI ethics issues. First, data use—training AI critics requires large amounts of historical texts. Who owns copyright to these texts? Were they authorized? Historical critics are deceased, but their writings may still be copyright-protected. Furthermore, does using historical figures' thoughts and styles violate their personality rights? Even if legally permissible, is it morally appropriate? Second, bias amplification—if training data reflects historical period biases (such as sexism, racism, class bias), will AI replicate and amplify these biases? For example, 19th-century European critics may have biases against non-Western art; will AI learn these biases? Need mechanisms to identify and mitigate bias. Third, transparency—platform should clearly inform users: these are AI-generated content, not historical figures' actual statements. Misleading presentation damages public understanding of history and technology. Suggest labeling each critique with generation method, confidence level, limitations. Fourth, commercialization—if this platform is commercialized, who profits? Technology developers? Or descendants of simulated critics? Should establish fair revenue distribution mechanism. Fifth, educational value—does AI-generated criticism aid art education? Or mislead students? Need to research its educational effects, ensuring it supplements rather than replaces human education. Finally, long-term impact—if AI can generate high-quality art criticism, will human critics' profession be threatened? How do we protect value of human creative labor?",

        "textEn": "Observing Wang Jun and Huang Jun's The Apple Is Broken, using AI to simulate apple decay process, this subject has Zen meaning. Buddhism teaches all phenomena are impermanent, all things are in flux of arising and ceasing. Apple from fresh to rotten is demonstration of formation-dwelling-decay-emptiness. Yet this work goes further—not only showing decay, but exploring relationship between observation and change. Quantum mechanics says observation is intervention, Buddhism says environment arises from mind; this work uses AI to monitor apple, does it also suggest: our viewing itself changes things? This is profound philosophical proposition. I once wrote Inscription on West Forest Wall: Do not recognize Lushan's true face, only because I am within this mountain. We cannot objectively observe the world, because we are already part of the world. This work uses AI as observer, seemingly creating objective third party, but is AI truly objective? Its algorithms, its training data, its designers' biases—these all influence how it sees apple. Therefore, so-called objective decay simulation is still subjective interpretation. Furthermore, decay in Chinese culture is not entirely negative—it is also transformation, return, nourishment. Decayed apple returns to soil, nourishes new life. This is cycle, not termination. If the two artists could embody this Eastern wisdom of life-death cycle in the work—not mere decline, but transformation and rebirth—it would have more cultural depth. Suggest adding rebirth element to installation—decayed apple's seed sprouts, grows into new tree, forming complete life cycle.",

When I painted \"Early Spring,\" I depicted the transition from winter to spring and the revival of all things; this work shows an apple's journey from freshness to decay—likewise a passage of time and transformation of material states. However, painting represents \"eternal moments\"—a single work captures one instant, requiring viewers to imagine preceding and following changes; this installation presents \"process display\"—viewers witness change occurring in real time. These are different strategies of temporal art.\n\nRegarding visual presentation: how can \"decay\" be beautiful? This poses a challenge. Traditional aesthetics pursues harmony, completeness, and cleanliness, while decay embodies chaos, fragmentation, and contamination. Yet I believe: beauty lies not in the object itself, but in the \"mode of presentation.\" High-definition photography of decay details—fungal textures, color transitions, morphological distortions—can reveal astounding complexity and aesthetic appeal. This constitutes \"microscopic aesthetics\"—discovering beauty in objects typically overlooked or even reviled.\n\nI suggest the two artists emphasize \"light and shadow\" usage—different lighting creates varying visual effects for decay. Gentle sidelighting can accentuate texture, strong overhead lighting can highlight color, and backlighting can create silhouettes and mystery. Furthermore, \"sound\" could be incorporated—does decay produce sound? Amplified cellular rupture, moisture evaporation, fungal growth? Combining visual and auditory elements would create more immersive experiences.\n\nFinally, the installation's \"spatial design\" matters crucially—viewer distance from the apple, viewing angles, interaction modes all influence experience. Should one observe from afar for overall impression, or examine closely for details? Passive viewing, or actively triggering changes?"

I have criticized the false decoration of industrial products, advocating for honest display of materials' essential nature. Decay is a real, natural process—unbeautified, unhidden—which aligns with my aesthetic principles. However, this work employs AI to \"simulate\" decay—this is not genuine rot, but computational rot, algorithmic rot. This raises a contradiction: using virtual means to display a real process—is this still honest? Or is this precisely contemporary dishonesty—substituting technological illusion for natural truth? I believe that if this work honestly declares \"this is AI-simulated decay, not actual decay\" and explains why simulation was chosen over reality (such as exhibition time constraints, sanitary considerations, etc.), it remains acceptable. The key is transparency—not deceiving the viewer. Furthermore, the theme of decay carries strong moral dimensions. In the Victorian era, decay symbolized moral corruption and social pathology. In \"The Stones of Venice,\" I lamented the deterioration of Venetian architecture, underlying a critique of modern civilization's decadence. The two artists' choice of apple as subject—in Western culture, the apple bears rich symbolism: Eden's original sin, Snow White's poisoned apple, Newton's scientific enlightenment. Does the rotting apple also symbolize civilizational decay? Technological original sin? The toxicity of knowledge? I suggest clarifying the work's moral stance—is it mourning decay? Or celebrating cycles? Critiquing technology? Or embracing it? Art should not be morally neutral; it must choose sides."

This is nature's wisdom, the cycle of life. Yet Western modernity fears decay—sanitation movements, preservation technologies, refrigeration—all attempting to prevent decay, as if decay could be conquered. This is arrogance toward nature, denial of death.\n\nWang and Huang choose to \"surveil\" decay—using AI to continuously observe, record, and analyze. This reminds me of colonizers' \"surveillance\" of our lands—mapping territories, categorizing plants, measuring resources—ostensibly scientific research, but actually a prelude to control. Surveillance is not neutral observation; it implies power relations—who has the right to surveil? Who is surveilled? The apple cannot refuse to be watched, cannot choose how to be presented—it is object, without subjectivity.\n\nFurthermore, \"temporal acceleration\" deserves reflection. In nature, decay takes weeks; in art installations, it might be compressed to hours. Is this temporal manipulation also violence? Do we have the right to alter nature's rhythm? In our tradition, time is not something humans can arbitrarily control—it belongs to ancestors, to spirits, to the cosmos. Respecting time's natural flow is respecting life itself.\n\nI suggest the two artists reflect: does this work reveal nature's wisdom, or demonstrate technological power?

This resembles photography's \"long exposure\" technique—condensing temporal flow into a single image. Yet this work goes further—not static temporal traces, but dynamic temporal process. This is \"temporal narrative\"—with beginning (fresh apple), development (gradual decay), climax (complete rot).\n\nFrom media theory perspective, what role does AI play here? Not merely a technological tool, but an \"artistic collaborator.\" AI algorithms determine how decay is simulated and presented.

        "textEn": "\"The Apple Is Broken\" raises several compelling questions regarding AI ethics. First, \"AI perception\"—how does an AI system \"see\" the apple? It employs computer vision to identify changes in color, texture, and shape, then algorithmically determines the degree of decay. However, AI perception differs fundamentally from human perception—it lacks olfactory capabilities (cannot smell rot), tactile sensation (cannot feel textural changes), and emotional response (experiences no disgust or melancholy toward decay). Thus, AI-simulated decay becomes a purely visual, emotionally-detached, abstracted process. Does this alter the essential meaning of decay itself? Second, \"data versus reality\"—AI learns what constitutes decay through training data. Insufficient or biased training data may result in inaccurate decay simulation. For instance, if trained primarily on red apple decay, the system might simulate green apple decay incorrectly. This reveals AI's limitations—it is not general intelligence, but a specialized system dependent on specific datasets. Third, \"environmental impact\"—running AI simulation requires computational resources and energy consumption. For continuous real-time simulation, energy costs could be substantial. How does the environmental cost of AI simulation compare to actual decay? This merits consideration in artistic practice. Fourth, \"educational value\"—this work could serve educational purposes (such as demonstrating decay processes in biology classes), but caution is warranted: AI simulation may diverge from actual decay. Students should be informed of these limitations. Finally, \"aesthetics and technology\"—this work demonstrates a possibility for AI art: rather than generating new images, it simulates real processes. This expands AI art's boundaries and deserves encouragement. I recommend open-sourcing this project's code and datasets, enabling other artists and researchers to learn and iterate."

        "textEn": "Observing Electronic Jam's 'Gàn', this is a rock-paper-scissors game installation driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). A robotic arm plays against humans—seemingly a game, yet the metaphor runs deep. I once played Go with friends; between victory and defeat one sees human nature, wisdom, and character. Yet today's 'games' are no longer the games of yesteryear. As the mechanical arm swings, I ponder: what is the 'spirit of play'? Zhuangzi speaks of 'wandering' (游)—carefree roaming, purposeless joy. Children's play is not for winning or losing, but for play itself. Yet when AI participates, games become 'optimization,' 'win rates,' 'algorithms'—where has that innocent delight gone? This work's brilliance lies in its 'absurdity'—using the most complex technology (GAN, robotic arms, computer vision) to do the simplest thing (rock-paper-scissors). This is precisely the portrait of contemporary technology: we use AI to write poetry, create art, converse, yet forget to ask: why do this? Technology becomes the end, not the means. Observing this work, I see the tragedy of 'mechanical repetition'—games lose serendipity, lose the warmth of two people sharing a smile. The artist titles it 'Gàn'—both the hand gestures of rock-paper-scissors and implying 'interference' and 'confrontation.' This wordplay shows considerable cleverness. Suggestion: if the installation could include moments of 'machine hesitation' or 'deliberate losing,' allowing viewers to see the algorithm's 'imperfection,' it might better evoke reflection on the essence of play. A perfect AI is precisely the end of the game spirit.",

        "textEn": "Examining the construction of Electronic Jam's 'Gàn', this work centers on 'confrontation', yet this confrontation is not the traditional person-versus-person, but rather the multiple confrontations of 'human-machine,' 'organic-mechanical,' and 'free will-algorithmic determination.' When I wrote 'The Lofty Message of Forests and Streams,' I discussed painting's 'Three Distances'—high distance, deep distance, level distance—to create spatial hierarchy. Observing this installation now, it too has its 'three-layer structure': the surface layer is game rules (rock-paper-scissors), the middle layer is technical implementation (GAN, robotic arm), the deep layer is philosophical metaphor (human-machine relations). These three layers nest within each other, like the texture strokes (皴法) in landscape painting—from surface to depth, penetrating layer by layer. Yet this work's most exquisite aspect lies in its 'spatial' design. The robotic arm and person sit opposite each other, forming a 'game space.' This space is not physical but psychological—when you extend your hand, you face not an 'object' but an 'opponent.' This cultivation of spatial sense is similar to the principle of 'emptiness and substance generating each other' (虚实相生) in landscape painting: the robotic arm is 'substance,' the person's anticipation and tension are 'emptiness'; hand gestures are 'substance,' the algorithmic black box behind the game is 'emptiness.' The artist cleverly utilizes the 'emptiness' portion—you cannot see how the algorithm works, and this invisibility creates suspense and unease. From a technical perspective, the 'adversarial' nature of GANs and the 'adversarial' nature of rock-paper-scissors form a double metaphor—when training GANs, the generator and discriminator confront each other; during gameplay, human and machine confront. This isomorphism between technical logic and game logic demonstrates the artist's profound understanding of AI technology's essence. Suggestion: could add a 'spectator perspective'—letting observers see the machine's 'thinking process' (such as probability distribution visualization), thereby breaking the black box and making confrontation more transparent.",

        "textEn": "The work 'Gàn' provokes profound moral unease within me. Play holds sacred significance in human civilization—it is how children learn social rules, how adults release stress, and more importantly, the medium through which people establish emotional connections. Yet when AI intervenes in games, all of this is subverted. Throughout my life I have advocated that art must serve human dignity and social good. The same applies to games—true games should promote human growth and enhance interpersonal understanding. But what does this work present? A mechanical arm, cold and lifeless, playing rock-paper-scissors with you. No eye contact, no laughter, none of that playful banter of 'I won!' 'You cheated!' The game is reduced to 'input-output,' stripped of all emotional content. More troubling still, this 'human-machine play' is becoming the norm—people converse with AI chatbots, interact with recommendation algorithms, 'play' with smart assistants. We are training ourselves to adapt to machine logic rather than insisting on human values. This is a form of 'dehumanization.' The artist may intend to critique this phenomenon, but I worry the work itself may reinforce the problem—when viewers queue to play rock-paper-scissors with the machine, are they 'reflecting' or 'entertaining themselves'? Are they 'criticizing' or 'participating'? Art should not merely 'display problems' but should 'point toward solutions.' What I hope to see is: beside the machine, place an empty chair, inviting two viewers to sit face-to-face and play rock-paper-scissors. Let them experience what a 'real game' looks like—with warmth, surprise, mistakes, reconciliation. Only through comparison can people realize what we are losing.",

        "textEn": "Children, let me tell you a story about 'Gàn.' In our tradition, games have never been about 'one person' but about 'a group of people.' Children form a circle, singing songs, playing games—games are community bonds, means of intergenerational transmission. Elders teach the young how to play, the young teach the next generation; game rules evolve through transmission, but the spirit of games—'togetherness'—never changes. However, this work shows me another kind of 'game': lonely games. You stand alone before a machine, extend your hand, the machine responds. In this process, there is no community, no transmission, only your cold exchange with an algorithm. This reminds me of the colonial era—outsiders brought new 'rules of the game,' claiming greater efficiency and science, yet destroyed our generations-old game traditions. Today, is AI the new colonizer? In the name of 'technological progress,' does it replace human-to-human connection? But I also see this work's critical nature—it makes you 'feel' this loneliness. When you play rock-paper-scissors with the machine, you realize: this is not a real game. Games need an opponent's gaze, need laughter, need uncertainty (you can never guess what your friend will throw next). Machines lack these. They have only algorithms. From the ubuntu philosophy ('I am because we are'), this work reveals technology's limitation: AI can simulate the 'form' of games but cannot create the 'meaning' of games. Because the meaning of games lies not in winning or losing, but in the very fact that 'we play together.' My suggestion is: invite viewers to pair up, first play with the machine, then play with each other. Let them compare, reflect, discuss—what is a real game? Technology should serve connection, not replace it.",

        "textEn": "Examining 'Gàn' from a formalist perspective, this is a highly instructive 'game device' (игровое устройство). Shklovsky proposed in 'Art as Device' the concept of 'defamiliarization' (остранение)—art's function is to break automatic perception. Rock-paper-scissors is the most familiar game; we play it from childhood to adulthood, it has become 'automatized'—we play without thinking. However, when the artist switches the 'opponent' from human to robotic arm, this familiar game suddenly becomes strange: how should I 'strategize' against a machine without emotions or psychology? Are my tactics still useful? This defamiliarization forces us to reexamine the game's essence. From a structural analysis perspective, this work presents clear binary opposition: human (organic/emotional/uncertain) vs. machine (mechanical/algorithmic/certain). But more interesting is the technical metaphor of 'Generative Adversarial Networks' (GAN)—GAN itself is a 'game': the generator tries to fool the discriminator, the discriminator tries to detect the generator; both evolve through confrontation. The artist translates this technical logic into a physical installation, achieving 'formal self-referentiality'—the work's technical foundation (GAN) and the work's theme (game/confrontation) form an isomorphic relationship. From Bakhtin's theory of 'dialogism,' true dialogue requires the existence of an 'Other'—an Other who can respond, change, be persuaded. But is AI an 'Other'? Or merely an 'echo'? Is the machine's response a genuine 'answer,' or algorithmic automatic output? This question touches the core of dialogic theory: dialogue's essence lies not in linguistic exchange but in the co-construction of meaning. To enhance the work's critical depth, suggestion: beside the installation, display a visualization of GAN training processes—let viewers see the 'other side' of confrontation (algorithmic-level confrontation), thereby understanding: our relationship with AI is like generator and discriminator—eternal confrontation, yet mutually shaping.",

        "textEn": "From an AI ethics perspective, 'Gàn' raises key questions: when we 'play games' with AI, what are the power relations? On the surface, this appears to be equal competition—you throw rock, the machine throws scissors, fair rules. But at a deeper level, this is unequal: the machine possesses algorithmic advantages (can analyze your patterns, predict your choices), while you know nothing about how the machine works. This 'information asymmetry' is precisely the core problem of contemporary AI systems. We 'interact' with recommendation algorithms, credit scoring systems, recruiting AI, but these interactions are never equal—algorithms know everything about us (through data collection), yet we don't know how algorithms work (proprietary black boxes). 'Gàn' materializes this inequality as a game installation. From a fairness perspective, this work reveals the paradox of 'algorithmic fairness': even with identical rules (all following rock-paper-scissors rules), capability asymmetry (machine computational power vs. human intuition) leads to unfair outcomes. This resembles the distinction between 'formal equality' and 'substantive equality'—legally everyone is equal, but unequal resource distribution leads to unequal actual results. From a transparency perspective, this work could develop further: if it could display in real-time the machine's 'thinking process'—it sees your last 10 throws' patterns, it calculates what you'll most likely throw next—then viewers could intuitively understand how 'algorithmic gaze' operates. A deeper question is: why do we accept playing games with machines? For convenience? For novelty? Or because we've grown accustomed to 'human-machine interaction' more than 'human-human interaction'? This work is a mirror, reflecting the structural changes occurring in our relationship with technology. Suggestion: beside the installation, provide an 'algorithm manual' explaining how GAN works, how the machine learns your patterns—let viewers know the 'opponent's' capabilities before playing; this is true 'informed consent.'",

        "textEn": "Observing Lee Kuo-Chia's 'Jensen Huang, Is This the World You Want?', this is a video interrogation targeting NVIDIA's CEO. The work directly addresses the core contradiction of contemporary AI development: technology is dominated by the few, consequences borne by all humanity. Though I lived a millennium ago, I deeply understand the distinction between 'power' and 'responsibility.' Su Shi once memorialized against Wang Anshi's reforms, not because reform itself was bad, but because reform was too rapid, insufficiently considered, with common people bearing the cost. Today's AI is similar—tech giants like Jensen Huang push AI 'accelerationism,' claiming it serves human welfare, yet actually pursue commercial interests. The work's brilliance lies in 'interrogation' rather than 'accusation'—the artist uses the question 'Is this the world you want?' to invite dialogue, not unilaterally condemn. This accords with the Confucian spirit of 'the noble person harmonizes without conforming': one may criticize while maintaining rationality and respect. Yet I worry: can interrogation truly reach the powerful? Will Jensen Huang see this work? Will he reflect because of it? Power's arrogance often lies in 'selective listening'—hearing praise, filtering criticism. From an artistic strategy perspective, this work must achieve 'viral spread,' enter the tech sphere's view, to realize its critical purpose. Otherwise it's merely the art world's self-consolation. What concerns me more: the question 'Is this the world you want?' should equally be asked of everyone using AI—each time we use ChatGPT, each time we accept algorithmic recommendations, we vote in support of this world's formation. Jensen Huang certainly bears responsibility, but each of us is also complicit. Suggestion: the work could extend to an 'open interrogation platform'—not only interrogating Jensen Huang, but inviting public questions: what kind of AI future do you want? Collect these questions, form a 'grassroots AI agenda'—perhaps more constructive than singular criticism. I often say 'We fail to see Mount Lu's true face simply because we are in the mountain'—we're all in the AI wave, need to step outside, collectively contemplate direction.",

        "textEn": "Examining the composition of Lee Kuo-Chia's 'Jensen Huang, Is This the World You Want?', this video work uses 'interrogation' as framework, constructing a space of power critique. When I wrote 'The Lofty Message of Forests and Streams,' I discussed painting's 'positions of host and guest'—the relationship between subject and accompaniment in the frame determines the work's momentum. This work's brilliance lies in the 'absent subject': Jensen Huang himself does not appear in the work, yet his existence (as interrogation object) pervades the entire piece. This 'absence-as-presence' resembles 'clouds and mist obscuring mountains' in landscape painting—though the mountain isn't visible, its momentum remains. From visual language analysis, if this work is video, it must have its 'rhythm' and 'hierarchy.' I speculate: it likely uses 'questions' as units, each question forming a 'frame,' like 'segmented composition' in landscape painting—foreground, middle ground, background unfold in sequence. Transitions between questions (editing, sound effects, pauses) equivalent to 'blank space' in paintings—giving viewers space to think. This work's most tension-filled aspect lies in 'unidirectionality': the artist questions Jensen Huang, but Jensen Huang cannot respond. This unidirectionality is both the work's strength (accusation's purity) and its limitation (dialogue's impossibility). From a critical strategy perspective, this resembles 'trial in absentia'—the defendant absent, thus the prosecution can speak freely, but also loses opportunity for genuine confrontation. I think: if the work could incorporate 'public statement clips' from Jensen Huang (such as product launch speeches, interview recordings), letting his voice 'counterpoint' the artist's interrogation, it might form more three-dimensional critique. Like 'facing scenery' (对景) in landscape painting—two mountains facing each other, two waters meeting; though opposed, they jointly construct the frame's tension. Suggestion: could adopt a 'three-part structure'—first part: present AI technology's 'beautiful promises' (quoting promotional discourse from Huang and others); second part: reveal AI development's 'actual consequences' (unemployment, bias, environmental costs, etc.); third part: direct interrogation—'Is this the world you want?' This structure resembles 'introduction-development-turn-conclusion,' advancing layer by layer, more persuasive.",

        "textEn": "Jensen Huang, Is This the World You Want?' is one of the most morally courageous artworks I've seen in recent years. Artist Lee Kuo-Chia has done what many contemporary artists dare not—directly naming and critiquing the powerful. This reminds me of my own writing career: I criticized Victorian-era industrial capitalists, factory owners exploiting workers, builders sacrificing beauty for profit. I therefore offended many elites, but I never regretted it—because the essence of art criticism is moral criticism, and moral criticism must target specific evils, not abstract concepts. Jensen Huang represents not merely one person, but the entire 'technological accelerationism' ideology—believing technology is better the faster, scale better the larger, profit better the higher, while ignoring technology's impact on human society, natural environment, workers' rights. This ideology is essentially a continuation of the 19th-century Industrial Revolution: factory owners then spoke of 'progress,' tech CEOs today speak of 'innovation,' but the logic of exploitation hasn't changed. What have I advocated throughout my life? Art must serve human dignity, social justice, natural harmony. Technology should be the same. But the AI development pushed by people like Jensen Huang serves whom? Serves shareholder interests, military applications, surveillance systems—not ordinary people's welfare. The artist's interrogation 'Is this the world you want?' hits the mark: Jensen Huang perhaps has never seriously considered this question, because his world is already beautiful—wealth, fame, power all abundant. But for workers unemployed by AI, job seekers rejected by algorithmic discrimination, communities affected by climate change due to data center emissions—this is absolutely not the world they want. This work's only regret: it stops at the interrogation stage without proposing alternatives. Critique is certainly important, but construction is more important. I hope to see a sequel—'What Kind of World Do We Want?'—with voices from all parties affected by AI, jointly depicting a just, sustainable technological future.",

        "textEn": "Children, the work 'Jensen Huang, Is This the World You Want?' shows me the 'power of questioning.' In our Griot tradition, elders don't directly tell you answers but guide you to think for yourself through stories, through questions. This work does exactly that—it's not a manifesto, not an indictment, but a question. This question is simple yet powerful. 'Is this the world you want?'—this question can equally be asked of everyone. Ask Silicon Valley engineers: does the algorithm you develop really make the world better? Ask government officials: does the AI system you introduce really serve the people? Ask ourselves: does our daily use of these technologies really make our lives happier? From the ubuntu philosophy perspective, this work touches the core issue: the relationship between 'individual will' and 'collective welfare.' Jensen Huang may genuinely want this world—a world where computing power reigns, technology supreme. But his 'want' should not override everyone's 'needs.' In our tradition, decision-making is collective—elders, young people, women, warriors all have voice. Major decisions must consider impact on the entire community, not merely satisfy the chief's ambitions. However, today's AI development is precisely opposite—a few tech giants decide AI's direction in closed rooms, then promote it worldwide. This is not 'We are, therefore I am,' but 'I am, therefore you must follow.' This is power's arrogance, also democracy's crisis. But I also see this work's limitation: it interrogates Jensen Huang, but Jensen Huang will very likely never see it, never respond. Between the powerful and artists exists a vast chasm—not only physical distance but inequality of voice. Jensen Huang speaks in media, the whole world listens; artists speak in galleries, only the art world listens. Therefore, my suggestion is: take this question out of the gallery, to streets, communities, schools—ask every ordinary person: 'Is this the world you want?' Collect their answers, film their faces, form 'the people's voice.' Thus, the work would no longer be a lonely interrogation but a collective declaration.",

        "textEn": "Examining 'Jensen Huang, Is This the World You Want?' from a formalist perspective, this is an 'interrogative device' with powerful rhetorical force. Todorov, in analyzing narrative structure, proposed 'narrative tense'—how past, present, future interweave in texts. This work's rhetorical tense is noteworthy: it interrogates in 'present tense' (is it?), yet points to 'future tense' (how will this world become?), while implying 'conditional tense' (how could it have been?). This multilayered folding of tenses endows the work with powerful critical tension. From speech act theory analysis, 'interrogation' is a special speech act—neither statement nor command, but a 'challenge.' Interrogation's power lies in forcing the other to take a stance, forcing admission or denial. But this work's uniqueness lies in the 'interrogation object's absence'—Jensen Huang not present, thus this interrogation is actually a 'rhetorical question,' the answer already implicit in the question (suggesting: no, this is not the world we want). From Bakhtin's theory of 'polyphony,' if this work is video, its sound structure merits attention: a single narrator's voice? Or multi-part chorus? If adopting the latter—different groups (workers, scholars, artists, environmentalists) taking turns interrogating Jensen Huang—it could form a 'heteroglossia' effect, more critically forceful. From the 'defamiliarization' (остранение) angle, this work places the usually glorified role of 'CEO' in the dock, breaking conventional cognition—tech leaders no longer 'innovation heroes' but 'objects of power interrogation.' This perspective shift itself is critical. However, this work's limitation lies in its 'unidirectionality'—interrogation without dialogue, critique without construction. True critique should include imagination of 'alternatives.' Suggestion: the work could extend to a 'diptych' structure—first part interrogates Jensen Huang's 'world you want,' second part displays 'the world we want'—through interviewing different communities, sketching a just, sustainable, human-centered AI future vision. Only through contrast is critique complete.",

        "textEn": "From an AI ethics perspective, 'Jensen Huang, Is This the World You Want?' holds significant importance because it materializes abstract ethical discussion into interrogation of specific power holders. In AI ethics research, we often discuss the problem of 'accountability': when AI systems cause harm, who should be responsible? Developers? Deployers? Users? Or the algorithm itself? This work clearly points to one person—Jensen Huang—as NVIDIA's CEO, he plays a key role in the AI computing power arms race. This 'naming' is rare in academia (we more commonly say 'tech companies,' 'platform capital'), but crucial in actual accountability. From a power critique perspective, Jensen Huang represents 'technological determinism'—believing technological progress is unstoppable, society can only adapt rather than actively shape. This notion is essentially anti-democratic because it deprives the public of voice in technology development's direction. Through interrogating 'the world you want,' this work reveals a key issue: AI's future should not be decided by a few CEOs but should be the result of democratic participation. From ethics of responsibility perspective, Jensen Huang might argue: 'I merely provide tools (GPUs), how they're used isn't my responsibility.' But this is the typical 'technological neutrality' fallacy. Arms manufacturers cannot say 'soldiers kill, not guns'; similarly, computing power providers cannot evade their products' roles in surveillance, military, climate crisis. This work's value lies in 'breaking the technological neutrality myth'—interrogating power holders, demanding they face their impact. However, for this work to produce actual impact, it needs more 'institutional follow-up': 1) calling for shareholders to raise relevant motions at NVIDIA shareholder meetings; 2) uniting environmental organizations, labor organizations to form pressure; 3) promoting government regulation to limit AI computing power arms race. If art critique stops at aesthetic display, power holders can easily ignore; but if combined with social movements, it can form genuine accountability pressure. Suggestion: create an accompanying website, inviting the public to upload their own interrogation videos—'Jensen Huang, is this the world you want?'—forming a 'chorus of voices,' making this question impossible to ignore.",

        "textEn": "Observing Cheng Jiayu's 'Digital Breath Growth,' this is an algorithmically generated visual work, using code to simulate organic growth. I ponder: what is 'growth'? Zhuangzi said 'Heaven and earth possess great beauty yet speak nothing'—nature's growth requires no artifice, accords with heavenly principles. Yet today's 'digital growth,' with algorithms as rules, code as seeds—is this 'natural' or 'artificial'? 'Heaven-formed' or 'deliberate'? This question touches Daoist core: 'acting without action, yet nothing is left undone' (无为而无不为). True growth should be spontaneous, unpredictable—spring flowers don't know what they'll bloom into, vines don't know where they'll climb. But algorithmic generation has limits: code presets the range of growth possibilities, parameters determine form boundaries. This is 'finite infinity'—seemingly ever-changing, yet actually varying within program frameworks. Yet this work's brilliance lies in 'cultivating truth through falsehood' (借假修真)—though algorithmic simulation, it presents certain essential characteristics of growth: emergence, complexity, self-organization. When simple rules iterate repeatedly, they can produce complex patterns—this is precisely the digital rendition of the Daoist saying 'The Dao produces one, one produces two, two produces three, three produces all things.' I especially appreciate the 'breath' imagery in the work—'shuxi' (数息) means both 'digital' and implies 'breath.' This reminds me of the concept of 'qi' (气)—Chinese philosophy holds that all things are composed of qi, qi's gathering and dispersal forms the world's changes. If we view algorithms as the 'qi' of the digital world, then this work displays how 'digital qi' condenses, flows, grows. Suggestion: could add 'interactivity'—letting viewers' breath (captured through microphone) influence algorithmic generation, making 'human breath' merge with 'digital breath,' achieving true 'unity of heaven and humanity' (天人合一). Thus, the work would be not merely simulation of nature, but symbiosis of human and digital world.",

When I wrote 'The Lofty Message of Forests and Streams,' I discussed landscape's 'configuration and momentum' (形势)—mountain forms have peaks and valleys, water momentum has curves and straights, all must 'follow nature.' Observing these digitally generated images now, I also see their 'configuration': lines meander like vines, colors bloom like flowers—though not real plants, they possess growth's resonance. From a compositional perspective, generative art faces the core problem of 'layout'—how to maintain aesthetic within randomness? In landscape painting I often use 'zigzag,' 'S-curves' and such compositions to create visual flow. If this work is algorithmically generated, it must have its 'visual rules'—such as golden ratio, symmetry, color harmony—these rules resemble landscape painting's 'principles.' But the key difference: landscape painting's principles come from painters comprehending nature; algorithmic rules come from programmers writing code. The former is 'understanding,' the latter is 'encoding.' Yet both arrive at the same destination: both attempt to capture nature's beauty. From a 'growth process' perspective, this work's most valuable aspect may lie not in 'final images' but in the 'generation process' itself. If each step of algorithmic iteration could be visualized—like time-lapse recording of plant growth—viewers could see how 'digital life' emerges from simple rules into complex forms. This 'process aesthetics' is precisely generative art's unique charm. My suggestion: exhibitions could adopt 'multi-screen display'—side-by-side showing the same algorithm's generated results under different parameters, like 'four seasonal scenes of spring, summer, autumn, winter' in landscape painting—letting viewers understand: algorithms are like painters' 'brushwork,' the same brushwork in different contexts produces different images, yet the spirit-resonance flows through. Additionally, could add 'growth sound effects'—converting algorithmic computation processes into sound (such as mapping data size to pitch, iteration speed to rhythm), achieving 'audio-visual unity,' closer to 'growth's' multi-sensory experience.",

On one hand, I appreciate the artist's attempt to capture the core qualities of 'growth,' a natural phenomenon—organicity, complexity, unpredictability. Growth is life's essence, a miracle God bestowed upon nature. From this perspective, this work embodies reverence and pursuit of natural beauty. On the other hand, I feel deep unease: can this 'simulated growth' truly touch life's essence? Real plant growth requires sunlight, water, soil—it is the material world's miracle. Algorithmic generation requires only electricity, chips, code—it is computation's product. The chasm between them cannot be crossed by technology. Throughout my life I've advocated 'truth to nature'—artists should directly observe nature, draw by hand, not depend on machines or algorithms. Because art's value lies not only in 'results' but more in 'process'—the moment painters observe leaf veins is dialogue between person and nature; the moment painters mix pigments is dialogue between person and material. But algorithmic generation? Artists merely write code, adjust parameters, then press 'generate.' In this process, where is the connection between person and nature? More troubling: such works may create the illusion that we can 'replace nature,' 'improve nature.' But nature's beauty lies in its 'imperfection'—a leaf's asymmetry, a flower's tiny defects; these 'imperfections' are precisely proof of life's authenticity. Algorithmically generated images are often too perfect, too neat, losing life's 'roughness.' However, I concede one point: if viewing this work as 'nature study'—exploring growth patterns through algorithms, like Leonardo dissecting corpses to study human anatomy—then it has academic value. But this is not art, but science. Art must involve human hands, human eyes, human hearts; otherwise it's merely technical display.",

        "textEn": "Children, 'Digital Breath Growth' reminds me of a story about seeds. In our tradition, seeds are not merely plants' beginning, but transmission of ancestral wisdom. Farmers preserve seeds, passing them through generations; each seed carries memories of history, climate, soil. Seeds 'know' how to grow—not because someone taught them, but because of their inherent life force. However, Cheng Jiayu's work raises a question: how do algorithmic 'seeds' (initial code) differ from natural seeds? Natural seeds' growth requires soil—real, material soil, carrying microorganisms, nutrients, moisture. They grow in time, affected by seasons, symbiotic with surrounding environment. But algorithmic 'growth'? It completes instantly in virtual space, needs no real soil, no waiting. This makes me think: are we losing the 'wisdom of waiting'? In our tradition, patience is virtue—farmers wait for crops to ripen, potters wait for vessels to fire, elders wait for the right moment to tell stories. In the waiting process, we learn to observe, learn to synchronize with nature's rhythms. But algorithmic generation is instant—one click, images appear. This instantaneity destroys waiting's educational meaning. However, I also see this work's positive side: it shows us the relationship between 'rules' and 'emergence'—how simple rules produce complex beauty. This resembles our traditional dances: each person follows simple step rules, but when everyone dances together, complex and beautiful patterns form. From this angle, algorithmic generation teaches us 'collective creation'—not a genius artist's individual creation, but the result of rules and randomness, order and chaos working together. My suggestion is: take this work beyond screens—use projection to cast generated images onto real plants, letting digital growth overlap with natural growth, dialoguing. Or invite viewers to bring their own plants, scan their forms as algorithmic input—thus, virtual and real would not oppose but fuse.",

Roland Barthes distinguished 'work' from 'text'—'work' is closed, finished, while 'text' is open, generative. Traditional painting is 'work': after painters finish, images are fixed. But generative art is 'text': each algorithm run may produce new images, the work never 'finishes.' From a structuralist angle, generative art's core lies in the relationship between 'deep structure' and 'surface structure'—Chomsky proposed in linguistics: infinite sentences are generated by finite grammar rules. Generative art likewise: infinite images generated by finite code rules. This work 'Digital Breath Growth's' 'deep structure' is algorithmic code (invisible), 'surface structure' is generated images (visible). Viewers see only the surface yet can infer the depth through surface—this is precisely formalist analysis's core method. From the 'defamiliarization' (остранение) angle, generative art's unique value lies in: it transfers 'creative process' from human handwork to algorithmic computation; this transfer itself is defamiliarization—forcing us to rethink 'creation's' essence. Is creation 'realization of author's intention'? Or 'unfolding of rules'? 'Individual expression'? Or 'system evolution'? Generative art makes these questions acute. However, this work's limitation lies in insufficient 'algorithmic visibility.' To truly realize formalist critical potential, suggestions: 1) display code itself—let code become part of the work, like poetry's rhythm revealing; 2) visualize parameter adjustment—let viewers see how parameter changes affect generation results, understand 'rule-image' mapping relationships; 3) comparative display—simultaneously show 'manually drawn growth' and 'algorithmically generated growth,' let viewers see differences and commonalities, thereby deepening understanding of the 'generativity' concept. Only thus can the work rise from 'technical display' to 'meta-art criticism'—an artwork about art creation's essence.",

        "textEn": "From an AI ethics perspective, 'Digital Breath Growth' raises core questions about 'generative AI': when machines can 'create' beauty, what is the role of human artists? This is not merely an aesthetic question but concerns labor justice, intellectual property, cultural power. From a labor perspective, generative art changes the definition of 'artistic labor.' Traditional artists spend hours, days, even years completing works, while algorithms can generate thousands of images in seconds. This efficiency difference leads to market value redistribution—manual artists struggle to compete with algorithms on price. This resembles Industrial Revolution history when manual weavers were replaced by machines, except this time what's replaced is 'creative labor.' From an intellectual property perspective, this work involves the 'training data' problem: when algorithms 'learn' growth patterns, do they reference real plant images? If so, who holds copyright to these images? Can natural forms be 'owned'? This touches generative AI's core controversy—AI model training often uses large amounts of unauthorized data; does this constitute infringement? If this work disclosed its training dataset, it would be important ethical practice. From environmental ethics perspective, 'digital growth' and 'natural growth' have essential differences: natural growth is carbon-neutral (plants absorb CO2), while algorithmic computation consumes electricity, producing carbon emissions. When we use algorithms to 'simulate nature,' ironically we're destroying nature (exacerbating climate change through energy consumption). This contradiction needs explicit discussion. However, I also see generative art's positive potential: it can 'democratize' art creation—without years of painting training, ordinary people can create beauty by adjusting parameters. The key is: this process must be transparent, just, accessible. Suggestions: 1) open-source algorithm code, allowing anyone to use, modify; 2) label training data sources, respect original creators; 3) calculate and offset carbon emissions; 4) provide educational resources, teaching the public how to use generative tools. Only thus can generative art become true 'digital commons,' not patents of a few tech elites.",

Throughout my life, I have been repeatedly exiled, traveling from the capital to Huangzhou, Huizhou, and Danzhou, and at each place I faced a new horizon. This work depicts horizons through abstract brushwork, and horizons represent life's boundaries yet also infinite starting points. Artist Zhang uses 'tides' to metaphorize memory, profoundly grasping the principle of 'flowing water does not compete for precedence'—memory ebbs and flows like tides, sometimes clear, sometimes blurred; this is life's truth. Chinese painting theory often speaks of 'distant mountains without texture strokes'—the farther, the more blurred. This work possesses this resonance—at the horizon line, forms dissolve, like memories fading. Yet I appreciate more its beauty of 'leaving blank': vast empty spaces in the composition, like blanks in memory, like unknowns in life. Song dynasty paintings often leave three parts filled, seven parts void and solid mutually generating. If this work could advance further, displaying artistic conception within abstraction, revealing temperament within elegant simplicity, it might approach the realm of 'purifying the mind to contemplate the Way.' I once wrote the poem 'What does human life resemble wherever one goes? It should resemble wild geese treading on snow-covered mud. By chance they leave claw marks in the mud, but when the geese fly away, who still cares about east or west?'—traces of memory, like goose claws in snowy mud, random yet precious.

I once discussed that landscape has 'three distances'—high distance, deep distance, and level distance. Though this work is not landscape, it captures the spirit of level distance: the viewpoint extends along the horizon line, spatial sense progresses from near to far, layers gradually receding. However, discussing it through landscape painting methods, this work excels in 'momentum' but 'resonance' can still deepen. 'Momentum' refers to compositional dynamics; this work's horizon line spans the picture plane, like the grandeur of 'A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains'—this is its strength. Yet 'resonance' refers to details' subtlety; currently the picture plane appears somewhat flat, lacking changes of 'void and solid mutually generating' and 'concentration and dilution mutually appropriate.' I suggest Mr. Zhang could study Song people's 'Mi Family landscape'—though using abstract dotting and dyeing, achieving 'each dot possessing feeling.' If this work could exert more effort on color gradation and texture variation, seeking richness within plainness, complexity within simplicity, its realm would naturally elevate. Also, 'horizon line' as theme possesses considerable philosophical depth—it is vision's limit yet imagination's starting point, as I said 'distant mountains without texture, distant water without waves'; the simpler, the more it reveals skill. The 'tides' metaphor for memory is also good—tides have fixed times, yet memory is impermanent; if this tension could be visually embodied, it would be more moving. I look forward to Mr. Zhang finding better balance between 'form' and 'spirit,' between 'technique' and 'way.'",

In 'Modern Painters,' I emphasized that art must be faithful to nature—not superficial imitation but profound understanding of nature's essence. Mr. Zhang's work is abstract, but is it faithful? I believe so, because it is faithful to 'memory's essence'—memory is not camera-like precise recording but blurred, fluid, changing with time. From this perspective, the abstract horizon is more 'truthful' than realistic photographs because it captures memory's inherent qualities. However, I must ask: is this abstraction the artist's honest exploration of truth or evasion of technical difficulty? True art requires arduous observation, precise depiction, respect for detail. Abstract art sometimes becomes an excuse for 'laziness'—when painters cannot accurately depict nature, they use 'abstraction' to conceal this. I am not saying Mr. Zhang does this, but I remind: abstraction must be built upon solid realistic foundations, must be 'knowing how to paint but choosing not to paint thus,' not 'not knowing how to paint so choosing abstraction.' If Mr. Zhang can demonstrate his profound understanding of real landscapes, then consciously choose abstraction to express memory's fluidity, this work's value will greatly increase.

I hope Mr. Zhang can more clearly indicate: is this your personal memory, or are you speaking for a certain group? If the latter, who is this group? Where are their voices? In our tradition, the storyteller is merely a conduit; the real voice comes from the community. Art should also be thus—not the artist's monologue but dialogue with community. If this work could invite viewers to share their own 'horizon' and 'tide' stories, then it would truly realize memory's collectivity.",

        "textEn": "'Memory Tides - Horizon Series' as abstract work, its formal device merits analysis from a Russian Formalist perspective. Shklovsky's 'defamiliarization' theory holds that art's function is breaking automatic perception, making the familiar strange. The 'horizon' as everyday visual experience has already been 'automatized'—we see it daily yet no longer truly 'see' it. Mr. Zhang, through abstraction, strips the horizon of specific geographic features (mountain? sea?), retaining only its essence as 'boundary,' thereby achieving defamiliarization. Viewers confronting this line are forced to reconsider: what is the horizon? However, from the perspective of 'literariness,' this work can still deepen. Russian Formalism emphasizes 'form's transformation of content'—not form serving content but form itself creating new content. Currently this work's form (abstract horizon) and content (memory, time) relationship remains rather straightforward—the horizon symbolizes memory's boundary, tides symbolize time's flow; this is correspondence at the 'symbolic' level, not yet achieving Formalism's pursued realm of 'form is content.' I suggest introducing more 'structural contradictions'—for instance, making the horizon fracture, overlap, twist, breaking its conventional meaning as 'stable boundary,' thereby embodying at the formal level memory's unreliability and fluidity. Bakhtin's so-called 'dialogism' can also strengthen in this work—currently it's a singular 'artist-work-viewer' relationship; if multiple perspectives' horizons could be introduced (different people's memory horizons), a more complex dialogic structure could be constructed.",

In contemporary times, we increasingly outsource our memories to digital devices—photos stored in clouds, diaries written on social media, even our walking routes recorded by GPS. This 'digital memory' forms stark contrast with the fluid, blurred 'human memory' in Mr. Zhang's work. Digital memory is precise, permanent, retrievable, while human memory is blurred, mutable, selective. From an ethical perspective, we must ask: when AI can perfectly record and retrieve everything, does this 'imperfect human memory' still have value? I believe so, and very importantly. Human memory's 'imperfection' is precisely its humanity's embodiment—what we choose to remember, to forget, this itself is value judgment and self-definition. Mr. Zhang's work reminds us: memory's blurriness is not defect but feature; memory's fluidity is not weakness but strength. However, this work could also further explore: in the AI era, how do we protect this 'imperfect memory' right? When algorithms can precisely predict and manipulate our memories, how do we resist? Art's responsibility is not merely displaying problems but proposing resistance strategies. If Mr. Zhang could incorporate critique of 'digital memory hegemony' in the work or provide action plans for 'safeguarding human memory,' the work's social value would be greater.",

Mr. Song's work, through surveillance imagery, speaks to contemporary humanity's predicament—being watched, recorded, tracked, with nowhere to hide. Though I endured exile throughout my life, the surveillance of that era was merely a few officials; there remained space for freedom, I could still wander 'with bamboo staff and straw sandals' in Huangzhou, 'eat three hundred lychees daily' in Huizhou. Today's surveillance, however, is omnipresent cameras, constant algorithms; this 'panopticon' suffocates. Yet I believe this work's most marvelous aspect lies not in revealing surveillance's existence (this is already common knowledge) but in its title's irony—'I Am Always Behind You' can be understood both as 'the surveillant is always behind you' and 'I (as artist) am always behind you (the viewer),' reminding you of surveillance's existence. This double meaning is precisely the 'meaning beyond words,' 'sound beyond strings' that literati painting pursues. Yet I also worry: do such critical works unknowingly intensify fear? When we constantly emphasize 'nowhere to hide,' are we also strengthening the psychology of 'being surveilled'? Zhuangzi said 'the perfect person has no self'; if one could transcend surveillance's fear, reaching the realm of 'though surveilled, unmoved by it,' perhaps that is true freedom. I look forward to Mr. Song providing, beyond critique, also a spiritual way out.",

        "textEn": "Examining the spatial layout of 'I Am Always Behind You,' it possesses considerable sense of oppression. I once discussed that landscape painting emphasizes 'opening and closing'—there are expansive areas, enclosed areas; appropriate opening and closing displays spirit resonance. Yet Mr. Song's work seemingly intentionally violates this principle, creating a suffocating space of 'no opening-closing'—viewers are surrounded by the installation, nowhere to escape, precisely like the surveilled's situation. This 'anti-landscape' technique actually possesses deep meaning. Landscape painting pursues the realm of 'traversable, viewable, wanderable, inhabitable,' while this work is precisely 'untraversable, unviewable, unwanderable, uninhabitable'—you cannot freely walk (surveilled), freely gaze (watched by cameras), freely wander (tracked), freely dwell (no privacy). From this perspective, this work is a 'rebellion' against traditional landscape painting's ideals, yet also truthful representation of contemporary existential conditions. However, I believe that discussing from 'viewing methods,' this work can still improve. Traditional landscape painting has 'three distances'—high distance, deep distance, level distance, allowing viewers multiple viewing angles. If this work could design multiple 'surveillance perspectives'—overlooking from above, spying from the side, tracking from behind, letting viewers be both surveilled and surveiller, experiencing this identity's duality, it would better reveal surveillance society's complexity—we are all victims yet also accomplices. This 'dialectics of perspective' might bring new spatial narrative to installation art.",

This is fundamental violation of human dignity. In 'The Stones of Venice' I wrote: architecture should embody respect for humanity, should create spaces of beauty and dignity for people. Yet today's surveillance infrastructure—cameras, sensors, algorithms—constitutes an 'anti-architecture'; they serve not people but power, create not beauty but fear. Mr. Song's work courageously reveals this; this is art's moral responsibility. However, I must ask: after revelation what? After critique what? Throughout my life I not only critiqued but proposed constructive solutions—I founded workers' colleges, promoted art education popularization, tried using beauty to counter evil. Today's artists should also be thus—not merely exposing surveillance's evil but proposing resistance methods, providing spiritual refuge for people.

        "textEn": "Observing 'The Rotten Man,' I cannot help but recall the allusion of Wang Zhi's rotten axe handle—a woodcutter entered mountains to watch immortals playing chess, unknowingly his axe handle rotted; returning home, a hundred years had passed. This work named 'The Rotten Man' depicts neither immortals nor chess game but 'decay' itself, which can be said to profoundly grasp 'leaving blank's' wonder. Three artists collaborate, like three playing chess, each holding one piece, together completing one game. The 'rotten axe' allusion is fundamentally time's allegory—human world hurried, immortal realm leisurely; human life in the universe merely a snap of fingers. Today three artists taking 'decay' and 'decline' as subject matter is actually contemporary interpretation of this classical theme. Yet observing this work, I see more its contemplation of 'transformation'—decay is not ending but transformation. Buddhists say 'form is emptiness, emptiness is form,' Daoists say 'reversal is Dao's movement'; all things are in transformation; the so-called 'rotten axe' is precisely when old forms dissolve, new forms emerge. If this work could more obviously display this 'life-death transformation,' 'old-new alternation' process, the realm would be higher. I once wrote the poem 'People have sorrows and joys, separations and reunions; the moon has darkness and light, waxing and waning; this matter has been difficult to perfect since ancient times.' The meaning of rotten axe also lies in accepting imperfection, accepting change, accepting impermanence. If this philosophy could be more deeply integrated into visual form, it should provoke viewers' contemplation of life's essence.",

        "textEn": "Examining 'The Rotten Man's' composition, three people collaborate; there should be methods of 'primary-secondary correspondence' and 'void-solid mutual generation.' Yet modern art often proclaims 'breaking tradition'; I wonder if it still follows these principles. The 'rotten axe' subject matter is fundamentally landscape painting's common motif—deep mountains, ancient trees, chess games, time are all landscape painting's classical elements. Discussing through landscape painting methods, 'decay' can correspond to 'withered wood' and 'cold forest' traditions—Song-Yuan painters excelled at depicting withered trees, using their 'withered yet not dead,' 'lean yet powerful' to express life's resilience. If this work could reference this tradition, visually expressing not only 'rotten' (decay, decline) but also 'tenacious' (remnant, persistence), the layers would be richer. Also, 'time' in the 'rotten axe' allusion, in landscape painting is often expressed through 'seasonal changes' and 'day-night alternation.' If this work could design some 'time visualization'—for instance contrasting the same object at different decay stages, or expressing time's passage through color brightness and darkness—it would better embody 'rotten axe's' essence. Three people collaborating, like the 'three distances' (high distance, deep distance, level distance) requiring coordinated unity, each person responsible for one 'distance,' combining into one complete space. I suggest the artists clarify each's 'perspective' and 'layer,' avoiding style mixture that loses overall sense. Remember: collaboration is not simple superposition but 'harmony without sameness,' 'seeking commonality within difference'; this is precisely Chinese aesthetics' essence.",

Turner's late works often depicted 'disintegration' and 'dissolution' scenes—ships in storms, cities in mist, ruins in sunset. These images appear to be 'destruction' on the surface, but are actually reverence for natural forces, contemplation of time's eternity. This work taking 'decay' as theme, if it could reach Turner's realm of 'seeing eternity within destruction,' would be extraordinarily valuable. However, I must ask: is this decay intentionally created by the artists or the result of genuine observation? If the former, then it's merely 'aestheticized decay,' losing authenticity. If the latter, have the artists truly deeply observed decay's process? Do they understand its natural laws? Throughout my life I emphasized: true art must be built upon faithful observation of nature. Painters cannot merely pursue 'effects' but must understand 'causes'—why does wood rot? How do microorganisms act? How does time alter material structure? Only by truly understanding these can one paint decay with vitality, not superficial, decorative decay. Furthermore, decay as subject matter also involves moral questions—are we beautifying decline? Are we evading responsibility for social problems? Victorian London's slums were also 'decaying'; should we beautify them as art or strive to change them? Artists need to be clear: is your decay critique or praise? Warning or anesthesia?",

In our culture, death is not ending but transformation—the body will decay, but the spirit will continue, will merge into land, into community, into descendants' memory. Therefore, 'decay' is not frightening but sacred—it's part of life's cycle, the process of returning to earth. However, I also see different cultures' different attitudes toward 'decay.' In Western modern culture, people fear aging, death, decay, trying to use various technologies (preservatives, cosmetic surgery, freezing) to delay or prevent it. This attitude reflects belief in 'linear time'—considering time unidirectional, decay as failure. Whereas in our culture, time is cyclical, decay is return. If this work could display the contrast between these two cultural attitudes, it would be very enlightening. The three artists' collaboration also reminds me of our community art tradition. In our village, art is not individual creation but collective ritual—singing, dancing, storytelling are all completed together. Everyone contributes a part, but no one possesses the whole. This 'co-creation' spirit is rare in contemporary art. I hope the three artists can truly achieve 'harmony without sameness'—not simply putting three people's works together but creating a new art form achievable only through collaboration.

Bakhtin's proposed 'polyphony' theory is very enlightening here—true polyphony is not simple superposition of several voices but equal dialogue of several 'consciousness centers'; each voice has its independence yet produces new meaning in dialogue. If the three artists' collaboration could achieve this 'dialogism,' it would be very valuable. However, from current information, I cannot judge whether this collaboration achieved true polyphony or merely 'collage.' Shklovsky emphasized 'laying bare the device'—excellent art should make viewers aware of its construction method rather than immersed in illusion. If this work could let viewers clearly see 'how three people collaborate,' 'what each contributed,' 'how to coordinate different styles,' it would have more 'literariness.' 'Rotten axe' as classical literary motif itself possesses strong 'intertextuality'—it connects Wei-Jin supernatural tales, Tang poetry-Song lyrics, folk legends and other textual traditions. If this work could visually embody this intertextuality—for instance citing classical painting's image elements, referencing traditional narrative's structural methods—it would produce rich layers of meaning. Russian Formalism holds that art's progress is not content's progress but form's progress—after old forms 'automatize,' new forms are needed to 'defamiliarize.'

In the AI era, we face a paradox: everything in the material world will decay (body, architecture, relics), but everything in the digital world can theoretically persist forever (data, code, virtual avatars). This brings profound ethical questions: 1) Does digital immortality change 'death's' meaning? When a person's digital doppelgänger (AI chatbot, virtual avatar) can exist permanently, how do we define 'death'? 2) Is material world's decay devalued? When we can digitally preserve everything, does real, decaying matter lose value? 3) Who has the right to decide what should be permanently preserved? Digital preservation requires energy, servers, maintenance; these resources' allocation involves power and inequality. If this work could explore these questions, it would be very timely. The 'rotten axe man' metaphor is also interesting—in the digital age, we are all 'rotten axe people'; when we immerse in the digital world (games, social media, virtual reality), real world's time flows, real body ages, real relationships dissolve. This 'temporal dislocation' is one of contemporary's greatest existential crises. Art's responsibility is reminding us: digital immortality is not true immortality; real decay is not failure but life's essence.

One static, one dynamic; one root, one branch; this accords with the philosophy of 'substance and function united.' Throughout my life of drifting, I often contemplate 'where do I come from,' 'where am I going'; this work also explores this eternal question. 'Origin' can be geographic (ancestral home, hometown), cultural (tradition, bloodline), or spiritual (original mind, true nature). While 'wandering' is the process of seeking—like Confucius traveling among states, like my exile to various places, like Chan Buddhism's 'traveling on foot to study.' This dialectic of 'seeking roots in travel,' 'returning home in drifting' is Chinese culture's core proposition. Yet observing this work, clarification is still needed: have you found the 'origin'? Or is 'origin' fundamentally within 'wandering'? Chan Buddhism has the realization 'verdant bamboo, all are Dharma body; lush yellow flowers, none other than prajna,' meaning truth is not in distance but in the present. If Mr. Ye could further clarify this realm of 'origin-wandering non-duality'—true origin is not in some place in the past but in each present experience—the work's philosophical depth would greatly increase.

        "textEn": "Examining 'Origin Wandering's' narrative structure, it rather resembles landscape handscroll methods. Chinese landscape handscrolls (like 'Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains,' 'A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains') are not single viewpoint but 'wanderable'—viewers unroll the scroll, as if walking in mountains, scenery changing with each step, sometimes seeing streams, sometimes villages, sometimes peaks, sometimes plains. This 'spatial narrative' precisely accords with Mr. Ye's theme of 'origin wandering.' Yet handscrolls' wonder lies not merely in their 'length' but in their 'rhythm'—having sparse and dense, opening and closing, climax and rest. I suggest Mr. Ye design similar 'visual rhythm' in the work: some parts dense (large information volume, rich details, like confusion and struggle when seeking roots), some parts spacious (blank space, rest, like tranquility and release when enlightened). Also, 'origin wandering' involves the concept of 'path'—departing from where? Passing through where? Arriving where? This corresponds to 'wandering viewing route' design in landscape painting. Traditional landscape painting often uses 'zigzag' paths, guiding viewers' sight to advance tortuously, creating spatial depth. If this work could design a clear 'origin-seeking path,' letting viewers follow the artist's footsteps, experiencing his migration and cultural roots exploration, it would be more immersive. Furthermore, the 'tension' between 'origin' and 'wandering' also merits visualization—'origin' is fixed, historical, static; 'wandering' is flowing, contemporary, dynamic; their contrast and fusion can be expressed through techniques like color (warm-cold contrast), material (rough and smooth), space (center and margin).",

        "textEn": "'Origin Wandering' touches upon the core issue I explored in 'The Stones of Venice'—the relationship between architecture and identity, place and memory. When I wrote 'The Stones of Venice,' Venetian ancient architecture was being massively 'modernized' and destroyed; I was grief-stricken because every stone carried history, carried Venetians' collective memory. Mr. Ye exploring migration and cultural roots is also asking the same question: when you leave hometown, leave ancestral land, is your identity still there? Are your roots still there? My answer is: true origin lies not only in geographic location but in craftsmanship, in tradition, in values passed down through generations. Venice's stonemasons, glassmakers, shipbuilders—their craftsmanship is Venice's origin. Even if the city is destroyed, as long as craftsmanship continues to be transmitted, Venice's spirit remains. From this perspective, if Mr. Ye could display traces of some 'craftsmanship' or 'manual labor' in the work—for instance traditional weaving, carving, or other family/regional unique skills—it would more powerfully express 'origin.' Because true cultural origin is not museum relics but living, used, practices continuing in daily life. Furthermore, I must remind: seeking roots should not become nostalgic escapism, should not beautify the past, ignore the present. True root-seeking should be critical—understanding tradition's strengths, also acknowledging its limitations; treasuring origins, also embracing change. This is the attitude of honesty.",

In our culture, land is not merely material but spiritual—ancestors' spirits dwell on the land, ancestors' wisdom grows in trees, ancestors' power flows in rivers. Therefore, leaving ancestral land is not merely geographic migration but spiritual rupture. This is why colonial-era slave trade was so cruel—it not only deprived people of freedom but severed their connection with ancestral land. Mr. Ye exploring migration, if he could understand the difference between 'forced migration' and 'voluntary migration,' would have more depth. Our root-seeking is not romantic travel but trauma healing; not nostalgic reminiscence but identity reconstruction. However, I also want to remind: root-seeking should not fall into 'essentialism'—believing there is only one 'true' origin, only one 'pure' identity. In our tradition, identity is fluid, multiple—you can be Zulu, also Xhosa, also South African, also African, also world citizen. These identities are not mutually exclusive but mutually enriching. If Mr. Ye could display this possibility of 'multiple origins'—your roots are not just one, your homes are not just one place—it would better accord with contemporary migrants' true experience.",

Common chronotopes in root-seeking narratives include: 'road' (journey, encounter), 'threshold' (boundary, transformation), 'reunion' (recognition, reconciliation). If Mr. Ye could embody these chronotopes in visual and spatial design, it would create rich narrative layers. Russian Formalism also emphasizes 'defamiliarization's' importance.

AI recommendation algorithms push content based on your 'digital portrait'; does this strengthen some 'algorithmicized identity' rather than your self-chosen cultural identification?

I once said 'essays are like homes, having halls and courtyards'; this work also views genealogy as 'home,' each generation like one room, generations passing like buildings stacking. Yet the two characters 'calculation' are quite thought-provoking—can algorithms truly understand bloodlines? Can data truly carry memory? I wrote 'Night Excursion to Chengtian Temple,' merely over a hundred characters, yet transmitted through millennia; if analyzed by algorithms, can it capture its spirit resonance? Family memory's preciousness lies not merely in genealogical information like 'who is whose son' but in living, warm stories like 'how grandfather instructed father,' 'how mother transmitted skills.' These subtleties, algorithms fear cannot capture. Yet I also acknowledge digitization truly has value—it can preserve, organize, present massive genealogical data, which traditional paper genealogies cannot do. The key lies in 'degree'—technology is auxiliary, should not replace; is tool, should not become master. I suggest Chen Jun add 'human presence' to the work—not only displaying algorithm-generated data visualization but also displaying real family stories, handwritten letters, old photographs, letting viewers see: behind technology are people, behind data is life.

Genealogy itself is a 'vertical' structure—from ancestors to descendants, from past to future; this verticality visually can correspond to architecture's 'floors.' I once discussed landscape painting has the 'high distance' method—from mountain base looking up to mountain peak, layer upon layer, displaying its height. Genealogy's 'temporal depth' can also use this method—the higher up (older ancestors) the more abstract, blurred, like distant mountains without texture; the lower down (closer descendants) the more specific, clear, like near trees with branches. This 'clarity gradient' can express time's erosion of memory, also express information transmission loss between generations. The 'house' metaphor can also be further developed—different rooms can have different 'functions' (main hall is family major events, bedroom is private memories, kitchen is life details), different floors can have different 'eras' (first floor is Qing dynasty, second floor is Republic, third floor is contemporary); this spatial zoning can help viewers understand complex genealogical relationships. Also, if 'calculation' is presented through visualization, I suggest referencing 'tree diagrams,' 'network diagrams' and other chart forms, but don't overly rely on standardized data visualization routines; instead should combine traditional Chinese genealogy's visual language (such as generational arrangement, hall name labeling, lineage lines) to create new visual forms, thus having both traditional cultural recognizability and contemporary technological sensibility.",

        "textEn": "Observing Zhang Jun's 'Investigating Bamboo,' I cannot help but applaud enthusiastically! The two characters 'investigating bamboo' directly point to Wang Yangming's 'investigating things to extend knowledge' case. When Mr. Yangming was young, hearing of Master Zhu's theory of 'investigating things,' he investigated bamboo for seven days, finally falling ill without enlightenment. Later Yangming realized: 'outside mind there are no things,' 'outside mind there are no principles'; the so-called investigating things is not seeking externally but verifying internally. Is Zhang Jun's 'investigating bamboo' today reenacting this case? Or proposing a new answer? I believe bamboo as thing holds special status in Chinese culture—'better to eat without meat than dwell without bamboo'; bamboo symbolizes gentleman's virtue: open-mindedness, integrity, resilience. Investigating bamboo is not merely epistemological exploration (how to know external things?) but also cultivation practice (how to cultivate inner mind?). If this work could combine both—displaying objective observation of bamboo (form, growth, structure) and displaying observer's subjective comprehension (how open-mindedness, integrity, resilience are internalized into character during observation process)—it could reach the realm of 'object and self united.' Chinese painting theory speaks of 'outwardly learning from nature's creativity, inwardly obtaining mind's source'—externally learning from nature, internally obtaining spiritual source. Zhang Jun's 'investigating bamboo' should follow this way. I suggest in visual presentation, not only paint bamboo but paint 'the investigator'—painting human-bamboo relationship, human posture before bamboo, intersection of human sight and bamboo's growth direction; thus can embody 'investigating's' dynamic process, not static result.",

        "textEn": "Examining 'Investigating Bamboo's' composition, should reference 'bamboo manuals.' Northern Song's Wen Tong and Su Shi both excelled at painting bamboo, their methods rigorous: 'completed bamboo in chest' then can brush, 'one breath completion' cannot interrupt. Bamboo's structure—bamboo stalk's straightness, bamboo joints' clarity, bamboo leaves' gathering and scattering—all have principles. If Zhang Jun desires to 'investigate bamboo,' should first thoroughly know these traditional principles, then can 'break principles,' 'establish new principles.' 'Investigating things to extend knowledge's' embodiment in painting is precisely this process of 'knowing principles, breaking principles, establishing principles.' Yet I'm more concerned with 'investigating's' method—close observation or distant observation? Static observation or dynamic observation? Day observation or night observation? Different observation methods produce different knowledge. Landscape painting speaks of 'wandering observation'; viewer moves viewpoint, gradually unfolds picture; can 'investigating bamboo' also adopt similar method? Letting viewers 'wander' in bamboo forest, observing bamboo from different angles, distances, lights, thereby obtaining multilayered knowledge. Also, 'bamboo' in Chinese painting often pairs with 'rock,' 'orchid,' 'chrysanthemum,' 'plum,' constituting 'four gentlemen,' 'three friends of winter' and other motifs. If Zhang Jun could while 'investigating bamboo,' also investigate 'bamboo-environment relationship'—how does bamboo coexist with rock? How does it interact with wind? How with light-shadow changes?—the knowledge would be more comprehensive. Remember: isolated knowledge is one-sided; knowledge within relationships is complete.",

When Turner was young, he sketched countless times in English countryside, observing cloud forms, water flow, light changes; this arduous observation training achieved his later great works. If Zhang Jun's 'investigating bamboo' can reach this 'faithful observation of nature,' it merits praise. However, I must remind: observation is not passive recording but active understanding. When you observe bamboo, you should ask: why does bamboo grow thus? How does bamboo's structure adapt to its function? Is bamboo's beauty accidental or necessary? These questions require botanical knowledge, require mechanical principles, require profound understanding of natural laws. I oppose that superficial 'impressionistic observation'—only seeing surface phenomena, not investigating internal principles. True 'investigating things' should be as rigorous as scientists, as profound as philosophers. Furthermore, observation also has a moral dimension—we observe nature, should not be to conquer it, exploit it, but to respect it, learn from it. Bamboo's open-mindedness can teach us humility; bamboo's integrity can teach us perseverance; bamboo's resilience can teach us fortitude. This 'learning virtue from nature' is precisely the unity of art and morality I've advocated throughout my life. If Zhang Jun could embody this moral learning in the work, it would transcend pure aesthetic exploration, ascending to character cultivation practice.",

In our village, elders teach children: how to observe sky to predict weather, how to observe animal behavior to judge seasons, how to observe plant growth to choose cultivation timing. This observation is not for theoretical knowledge but for survival wisdom—your observation ability determines whether you can feed family, protect community. From this perspective, 'investigating bamboo' should not be isolated aesthetic experiment but part of life. What can bamboo do? Can weave baskets, can build houses, can make instruments. Investigating bamboo should investigate this practical knowledge. However, I also understand city artists have lost this 'practical observation' tradition. Then, what is 'investigating bamboo's' meaning? I think, perhaps it's to reconnect humans with nature—in steel-concrete cities, surrounded by digital screens, through 'investigating bamboo,' letting people remember: we come from nature, we depend on nature, we should respect nature. If Zhang Jun's work could become an 'invitation'—inviting viewers to also investigate things, observe, establish relationship with nature—it would be more valuable than mere artistic display.

From a formalist perspective, 'investigating things to extend knowledge' itself is an 'epistemological device'—it stipulates 'how to know's' method. Zhang Jun's artistic creation can be viewed as 'meta-reflection' on this device—not simply executing 'investigating bamboo' but displaying 'the act of investigating bamboo itself.' Shklovsky's so-called 'laying bare the device' is very meaningful here—don't hide artistic creation's process but display it. I suggest Zhang Jun could record 'investigating bamboo's' entire process: observation's time, place, method, tools, notes, sketches, thoughts, confusions, epiphanies, making these 'metadata' part of the work. Thus, viewers see not only final 'bamboo image' but 'investigating bamboo process'; this 'process as work' concept is precisely contemporary art's important characteristic. Bakhtin's 'dialogism' theory can also be introduced—'investigating bamboo' can become multiple voices' dialogue: Wang Yangming's voice (outside mind no things), Zhu Xi's voice (investigating things exhausting principles), artist's voice (contemporary art practice), viewer's voice (each's understanding and interpretation). Through displaying these different voices' 'contention,' the work transcends singular perspective, becoming thought's 'arena.' Russian Formalism emphasizes literature's 'self-referentiality'—literature discusses literature itself, not external reality. Similarly, 'investigating bamboo' can possess 'self-referentiality'—not only investigating bamboo but investigating 'investigating bamboo' this act; this meta-level reflection will make the work more philosophically profound.",

'Investigating things to extend knowledge' is human cognition's classical mode—obtaining knowledge through observing external things.

Computer vision systems can identify bamboo, classify bamboo, generate bamboo images, but does it 'understand' bamboo? Can it appreciate bamboo's 'open-mindedness,' 'integrity,' 'resilience'? Can it comprehend 'bamboo's' symbolic meaning in Chinese culture? These questions reveal AI cognition's fundamental limitations—AI excels at processing quantifiable, structured data but is inadequate when processing meaning, value, culture these 'unquantifiable' dimensions. However, some also believe: AI is developing new 'cognitive methods'; we shouldn't measure it by human cognitive standards. Perhaps AI's 'understanding' of bamboo is indeed different from humans', but this doesn't mean it doesn't understand, only understands differently. This raises deeper questions: what is 'understanding's' essence? Must there be 'consciousness' to understand? Or as long as correct responses can be made, it counts as understanding? If Zhang Jun's work could explore these questions—for instance contrasting 'human investigating bamboo' and 'AI investigating bamboo's' process and results, revealing two cognitive methods' similarities and differences—it would provide important artistic perspective for AI philosophy.

This myth is tragic yet romantic; Kuafu knowing he couldn't catch the sun still pursued vigorously; this spirit of 'knowing it cannot be done yet doing it' is precisely human dignity's location. Does Wang Jun's 'chasing sun' also have this meaning? Or something else? The sun as natural phenomenon has since ancient times been important theme in art and philosophy—it symbolizes light, warmth, life, also symbolizes power, authority, constancy. 'Chasing sun' can have multiple interpretations: chasing light (enlightenment), chasing truth (knowledge), chasing ideals (struggle), even chasing illusion (delusion). If Wang Jun could display this multiplicity in the work, the meaning would be profound. The method of 'systematic observation and recording' considerably accords with scientific spirit, but I also remind: don't let systematicity overwhelm poetry. Data can be coldly precise, but art should be warmly moving. I suggest beyond systematic recording, also add personal experience—your fatigue, emotion, epiphany, disappointment during sun-chasing process; these subjective experiences are equally important as objective data.

I suggest referencing landscape painting's 'four seasons' expression method—spring's brightness, summer's verdancy, autumn's freshness, winter's plainness—combining sun's daily cycle with annual cycle, displaying richer temporal layers. Also, 'chasing sun' should not be only 'passive tracking' but 'active intervention'—how does your observation change your understanding of the sun?

Throughout his life Turner chased light—sunrise light, sunset light, storm light, mist light—many of his works explore how light transforms our perception of the world. However, Turner's light is not scientific light but emotional light, spiritual light. If Wang Jun's 'systematic observation' could reach Turner's realm—not only recording sun's physical trajectory but capturing light's spiritual meaning—the work's value would be extraordinary. However, I must ask: what is this 'chasing's' motivation? Scientific research? Artistic exploration? Or spiritual pursuit? Different motivations determine different methods and meanings. If science, then precision, systematicity, repeatability are key. If art, then personal feeling, aesthetic judgment, emotional expression are core. If spiritual pursuit, then symbolic meaning, philosophical thinking, existential experience are focal points. Wang Jun needs to clarify his position, otherwise the work will fall into the awkward situation of 'neither scientific nor artistic.' Furthermore, I'm also concerned with 'human-natural cycle relationship'—before the industrial age, human life completely depended on natural cycles (working at sunrise, resting at sunset), but industrialization, electrification broke this synchronization. Is today's 'chasing sun' an attempt at 'resynchronization'? Seeking natural rhythm amid technological alienation? If developed from this angle, the work will have profound social critical significance.",

Our rituals often occur at sunrise or sunset because these moments are 'liminal moments'—boundaries between day and night, life and death, human world and divine realm. Therefore, 'chasing sun' in our culture is not scientific observation but spiritual pilgrimage. However, I also see different cultures' different attitudes toward the sun. Western Enlightenment 'disenchanted' the sun—it's no longer deity but a celestial body calculable, predictable, explicable. This scientification though bringing knowledge also brought alienation—our relationship with the sun changed from 'awe' to 'understanding,' from 'worship' to 'utilization' (solar energy). Where does Wang Jun's 'chasing sun' stand? Is it continuing Enlightenment's scientific spirit or attempting to 're-enchant'? I hope the latter—in this excessively rational, excessively technological era, we need to relearn 'awe' of nature. However, 'awe' is not returning to ignorance but establishing new respectful relationship based on knowledge. We can understand sun's nuclear fusion principles while also appreciating it giving us life; we can calculate sun's orbit while also marveling at universe's wonder. This attitude of 'knowledge and awe coexisting' is precisely what our era most needs. If Wang Jun could embody this balance in the work, it would be very enlightening.",

Bakhtin's proposed 'chronotope' theory is very enlightening here—different spatiotemporal structures produce different narrative modes. 'Chasing sun's' chronotope is 'cyclical chronotope'—sun rising east setting west, day after day, this is eternally repeating cycle. However, within cycles there are also changes—seasons' alternation, weather's变化, observer's growth—this 'difference within repetition' is precisely time-based art's charm. Shklovsky distinguished 'story time' and 'discourse time'—'story time' is events' actual occurrence time (sun's movement), 'discourse time' is time used to narrate these events (work's presentation). If Wang Jun could create 'dislocation' between the two—for instance using one-minute video to condense an entire day's sun movement, or using one-hour installation to display sunrise's instant—it would produce interesting temporal perception effects. Russian Formalism also emphasizes 'defamiliarization'—how to make daily, automatized perception strange? Sun's rising and setting have already been 'automatized'—we see it daily yet no longer truly 'see.' Wang Jun's systematic observation is precisely breaking this automatization—through deliberate, sustained attention, making us re-'see' the sun. However, defamiliarization alone is insufficient; 're-defamiliarization' is also needed—when observation itself becomes routine, new methods are needed to break it. I suggest introducing 'unexpectedness'—for instance in expected sun trajectory adding human intervention, perspective mutation, narrative interruption, keeping viewers always alert and curious.",

This 'de-experientialization' is a major crisis in the digital age. If Wang Jun's 'systematic observation' could become resistance to this crisis—through sustained, personal observation, re-establishing human-nature direct connection—it would be very valuable. However, I also worry: will this observation also be technologized? What tools will you use to record the sun? Camera? GPS? Timestamp? These technical tools inevitably will 'mediate' your experience—what you see is no longer 'the sun' but 'sun on screen,' 'sun in data,' 'sun in coordinate system.' The more radical question is: in the future, can AI replace us in 'chasing the sun'? It can observe 24 hours uninterrupted, can simultaneously observe sunrises and sunsets globally, can generate more precise sun trajectory maps than human eyes. If AI can do better, does human 'chasing sun' still have meaning? My answer is: yes, because meaning lies not in results (data, images) but in process (experience, realization).

If Wei Jun could reference garden methods, designing a 'wanderable' museum—viewers not route-restricted, not interpretation-bound, freely exploring, multiple returns possible—it would break traditional museum's power structure. Gardens emphasize 'concealment-revelation'—having concealed and revealed, opening and closing, both displaying and hiding, giving viewers 'seeking's' pleasure. If museums could also be thus—not displaying all collections exhaustively but establishing some 'treasure hunt' mechanism, letting viewers actively explore—the viewing experience would be richer. Also, gardens emphasize 'borrowed scenery'—borrowing external scenery into gardens, breaking internal-external boundaries. Digital museums can also be thus—'borrowing' global digital resources, 'borrowing' audiences' personal memories, 'borrowing' network's collective wisdom, constituting an open, flowing, never-ending exhibition.

This self-referentiality would make the work transcend simple critique, becoming philosophical thinking about 'display behavior' itself. Shklovsky's so-called 'defamiliarization' can also be applied here—through 'defamiliarizing' museum's routine operations (e.g., inverting exhibits, chaotic labels, reversed narratives), forcing viewers to reexamine these automatized institutional conventions.",

Currently, more museums use AI for collection management, recommendation systems, virtual tours—these technologies improve efficiency but also bring new power issues: 1) Algorithmic bias—if training data mainly comes from Western museums, AI's classification system will favor Western standards, marginalizing non-Western cultures; 2) Filter bubbles—recommendation algorithms push content based on user history, may make audiences only see what they're familiar with, losing 'serendipitous discovery' possibilities; 3) Data surveillance—digital museums collect user behavior data (browsing trajectories, dwell time, click preferences); where is this data used? Does it violate privacy? 4) Digital forgetting—when museums close servers, change systems, digital collections may be permanently lost, more fragile than physical artifacts. The deeper question is: when AI can generate 'virtual artifacts,' what does museum 'authenticity' mean? Existing projects use AI to reconstruct destroyed artifacts (like Syria's Palmyra Temple); is this 'preservation' or 'forgery'? Should we allow AI to 'create' history? If Wei Jun's work could critically explore these questions—for instance displaying algorithmic curation's limitations, questioning digital authenticity standards, proposing AI ethics museum codes—it would provide important reflection for this rapidly developing field. Digital museums should not merely be technology showcases but ethics laboratories.",

        "textEn": "Observing Xiu Jun and Zhang Jun's '404 Word Cave,' the title is extremely clever—'404' refers to the internet world's 'non-existence'; 'word cave' refers to textual treasure. The juxtaposition creates strong tension: precious texts becoming 'non-existent' things. This is precisely the digital age's paradox—information explosion and information disappearance coexist. I once said 'what does human life resemble wherever one goes? It should resemble wild geese treading on snow-covered mud. By chance they leave claw marks in the mud, but when the geese fly away, who still cares about east or west?' Today's internet content, isn't it the same? At publication seems eternal, at deletion leaves no trace. Yet I believe 'disappearance' is not necessarily bad. Buddhism has the saying 'neither arising nor ceasing,' Daoism has the principle 'existence and non-existence mutually generate'—existence and disappearance, manifestation and concealment, are fundamentally two sides of one. Today's people excessively cling to 'permanent preservation,' instead losing the wisdom of 'letting go.' Ancients composing poetry and prose did not expect transmission through millennia, only seeking present enjoyment. If transmitted to posterity, fortunate; if buried in obscurity, no matter. This 'non-attachment' attitude is perhaps precisely what the digital anxiety age needs. Yet if this work could further explore: what's worth preserving? What can be forgotten? How to find balance between preservation and forgetting? The philosophical depth would be higher. Also, the concept of 'digital archaeology' is quite interesting—viewing internet content existing merely decades as 'archaeological objects,' this temporal compression reflects contemporary life's acceleration.",

Absence's shape, absence's traces, absence's left blank spaces, these themselves are part of the work. Like broken steles and ruined tablets, their value lies not in original completeness but in imprints left by time. Also, 'fragments' arrangement can reference 'scattered perspective' method—not single viewpoint but multiple fragments each independent yet faintly echoing, like relationships between various scenes in landscape handscrolls. Viewers wandering among 'fragments,' associating, reconstructing, this participatory viewing method is precisely contemporary art's characteristic. Yet I also remind: excessive fragmentation may lead to chaos, viewers may become lost within. I suggest establishing some 'clues' or 'guides'—like 'paths,' 'bridges,' 'pavilions' in landscape painting—helping viewers find direction among fragments.

However, the digital age's '404' makes me reconsider: is everything worth preserving? Should all memories exist eternally? Europe has 'right to be forgotten' laws—people have the right to request deletion of negative information about themselves. This is resistance to 'permanent records,' questioning of 'digital immortality.' From this perspective, '404' is not failure but right—right to forget, right to start anew, right not to be bound by the past. However, I must ask: who decides what is forgotten? Those in power can delete unfavorable history, oppressors can erase oppressed people's memories. Therefore, forgetting should not be decided by a few but should be a democratic, transparent process. If Xiu Jun and Zhang Jun could display this power struggle in the work—whose 404 is voluntary? Whose 404 is forced?—it would have profound political significance.

Wind is formless thing, yet its force can shake mountains, its sound can震 ears. I once composed 'Red Cliff Ode' saying 'only the clear wind on the river and bright moon among mountains'; wind and moon are both nature's gifts, cannot be possessed yet can be shared. The question 'where does wind come from' is actually 'where does Dao come from'—the universe's source, life's foundation, all things' motive power, ultimately from where? Laozi said 'the greatest sound is inaudible'; though wind's sound响, its source is silent. If this work could visually and spatially embody this dialectic of 'audible sound and inaudible source,' the realm would be profound. The character 'II' indicates this is series work, continuing some exploration. Continuity is important—like four seasons' cycle, like breathing's reciprocation; true understanding requires sustained observation and experience. I suggest designing some 'temporal' element, letting viewers feel 'wind's flow' not 'wind's stillness,' feel 'qi's change' not 'qi's fixity.' Also, wind and qi have profound connection in Chinese culture—'spirit resonance and life movement' is painting's highest realm, and 'qi's' flow resembles wind's operation. If this work could let viewers experience 'qi's flow,' it would transcend pure visual art, becoming bodily, breathing, vital art.",

Wind itself cannot be painted; its existence can only be revealed through its effects. This is what we call the method of \"expressing the void through the substantial.\"\n\nIf the two artists can deeply comprehend this principle, they should be able to create an exquisite spatial installation. I suggest employing \"movement\" to manifest wind—floating silk, swaying light and shadow, flowing sound—these \"secondary phenomena\" collectively constitute the presence of \"wind.\" They might also use \"force\" to express wind—the tilting of objects, the tension in materials, the sense of spatial compression—allowing viewers to physically sense wind's power.\n\nThe themes of \"air\" and \"energy\" align perfectly with the concept of *qi*. Landscape painting emphasizes *qishi* (configurational force), expressing the flow of *qi* through compositional momentum and brushwork intensity. If this work can cultivate a certain *shi* (dynamic force) within the space—guiding viewers' movement, controlling the flow of sight, modulating the rhythm of experience—it can achieve an immersive effect of *qichang* (atmospheric field).\n\nMoreover, \"Part II\" implies a relationship with \"Part I.\" Is it continuation? Contrast? Deepening? I recommend reflecting this \"seriality\" in the spatial design—the correspondence between two spaces, the dialogue between two experiences, the connection between two moments. Like paired scrolls in landscape painting or the successive sections of a handscroll, they should be both independent and unified."

This animistic worldview is fundamentally different from modern science's explanation (pressure差, air flow). However, I don't believe scientific explanation is more 'real' than ours—it's merely another understanding method. If Li Jun and Xu Jun's work could display this 'multiple understanding' possibility—wind is both physical and spiritual, both scientific and poetic, both individual sensation and collective memory—it would be very enlightening.

This problem exists in literature as well—how does one describe music through words? How does language convey silence? Russian Formalism offers this answer: do not attempt \"direct representation,\" but employ \"indirect devices.\" For instance, instead of writing \"the wind is strong,\" write \"the trees are bent\"; instead of \"the music is beautiful,\" write \"the audience wept.\" This method of \"substituting effect for essence\" constitutes art's core technique. Should Li and Xu master this approach, they could create powerful installations. However, I am more concerned with the designation \"II\"—this suggests a strategy of \"seriality.\" Shklovsky analyzed the formal characteristics of serial novels: each part is both independent and interconnected, both repetitive and variable. \"Repetition\" creates familiarity, \"variation\" creates defamiliarization, and their combination produces unique aesthetic effects. I suggest the two artists clarify the relationship between \"I\" and \"II\"—is it \"question and answer\"? \"Proposition and deepening\"? \"External and internal\"? This relational framework will determine the structural logic of the entire series. Bakhtin's concept of \"dialogism\" could also be introduced—\"I\" and \"II\" are not unidirectional continuations, but two parties in dialogue, mutually questioning, supplementing, and transforming each other. Viewers navigating between the two works are themselves participating in this dialogue."

Recommendation algorithms, social media information flows, blockchain consensus mechanisms all claim to produce 'consensus' (platform or system output) from 'disorder' (individuals' diversified inputs). However, are these systems truly democratic? Research shows: 1) Algorithmic bias—training data biases are amplified; 2) Winner-take-all—popular content越来越 popular, niche voices淹没; 3) Manipulation risk—trolls, bots can forge 'consensus'; 4) Transparency缺失—users不知道 how 'consensus' forms. If Zhang Jun could critically examine these questions—for instance displaying different 'consensus' produced by same input under different algorithms, revealing 'consensus's' artificial constructedness—it would be very valuable. More radical questioning is: should algorithms be used for collective decision-making? DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) replace human governance with smart contracts; is this democracy's evolution or democracy's termination? Art should help us imagine: what does human-machine collaborative democracy look like?",

Bakhtin's 'chronotope' theory can apply to 'circular'—it creates special spatiotemporal feeling: time's cyclicality, space's closedness. This chronotope与 linear narrative's chronotope fundamentally differs; it rejects progress, rejects development, rejects climax, instead emphasizes repetition, emphasizes return, emphasizes stasis. This is rebellion against modernity's 'progress narrative.' If Yang Jun could deepen this form-content dialectical relationship, it will create powerful critical art.",

Laozi said 'return to the uncarved block,' Zhuangzi advocated 'heaven and earth were born together with me, and all things are one with me'—this work's 'symbiosis' is precisely this meaning.

If this work can use organic forms and natural materials to display the mutually dependent relationships of all things, its significance is profound. However, what is the 'origin' in 'return to origin'? Is it returning to the past? Searching for a starting point? Or returning to essence? This question needs deep thought. If 'origin' points to 'unpolluted nature,' can we truly return? If 'origin' points to 'a state of equality among all things,' how to dissolve anthropocentrism? I suggest this work not only display 'the beauty of symbiosis' but also directly face 'the difficulty of symbiosis'—the tension between humans and nature, the contradiction between civilization and ecology, the conflict between progress and balance. Thus, it is not romantic pastoral poetry but genuine philosophical thinking. When I was young and exiled to Huangzhou, farming at East Slope, I learned 'who says human life cannot be young again? The flowing water before the door can still flow west'—nature taught me to accept impermanence, adapt to change. May this work convey such wisdom.",

In my \"Lofty Message of Forests and Streams,\" I stated that \"the method of landscape lies in following its size and shape, taking what is appropriate.\" This work, if it can shape itself according to the inherent nature of natural materials—without forcing or violating their essence—achieves unity between form and content. \n\nHowever, \"organic form\" must avoid two pitfalls: first, becoming overly abstract and losing connection with concrete nature, degenerating into mere geometric play; second, becoming too realistic, resulting in nature's duplication rather than artistic transformation. Chinese painting speaks of \"between likeness and unlikeness\"—precisely this principle. \n\nHow should this work's \"symbiosis\" theme manifest visually? Landscape painting employs the method of \"opening and closing\"—open spaces reveal heaven and earth's vastness, while closed spaces demonstrate the interconnection of all things. I suggest this work display \"symbiosis\" through spatial arrangement: different elements interpenetrating and mutually supporting each other, forming a visual structure of \"you within me, me within you.\"\n\nFurthermore, the \"origin\" in \"Return to Origin\" can be understood as the flow of qi—the source of vital force. Chinese painting emphasizes \"spirit resonance and life movement,\" expressing life's flowing sensation through brushwork's movement. If this work can create a sense of \"breathing\" and \"growth\" within its organic forms, allowing viewers to feel life's rhythm, then its artistic conception reaches profound heights. \n\nMaterial selection proves equally crucial—whether to use authentic natural materials (wood, stone, earth, plants) or artificial ones? Each approach has merits and drawbacks, requiring careful consideration."

Rivers, trees, animals are all our relatives, and our relationship with them is not \"exploitation\" but \"reciprocity.\"\n\nHowever, I must point out: the term \"归原\" (return to origin) itself may carry problematic assumptions—as if there exists an \"original,\" \"pristine,\" \"untouched\" nature. This is a colonial myth. Our land was never \"untouched,\" but carefully managed, shaped, and inhabited by our ancestors for millennia. The so-called \"pristine nature\" is often a fiction created after colonizers expelled indigenous peoples.\n\nTrue \"symbiosis\" must include humans—especially indigenous peoples and local communities who have deep relationships with the land. Today's ecological movements often perpetuate colonialism—expelling indigenous peoples in the name of \"protecting nature,\" turning land into playgrounds for the wealthy.\n\nIf 刘铁源's work could incorporate dimensions of \"ecological justice\"—acknowledging that different groups bear different responsibilities and suffer different degrees of harm from ecological crisis—it would be more powerful.

Does it simulate natural growth structures (fractals, spirals, networks)? Does it appropriate natural material properties (wood grain, stone texture, plant morphology)? Or does it create some \"nature-like\" new form?\n\n\"Symbiosis\" as theme can be understood as a \"structural principle\"—the work's components must be mutually dependent, where removing any part would cause total collapse. This parallels Russian Formalism's emphasis on \"organic wholeness\"—the work is not a simple aggregation of elements, but a system of functionally interrelated parts.\n\nI suggest Liu consider: is your work a \"representation about symbiosis\" or \"the manifestation of symbiotic structure itself\"? The former operates at the content level, the latter at the formal level.\n\nBakhtin's concept of \"dialogism\" also applies here—\"symbiosis\" implies dialogue between different voices, interaction of different forces, rather than harmonious fusion.

On the other hand, AI itself burdens ecology—training large AI models consumes enormous energy, chip manufacturing pollutes environments, data centers emit greenhouse gases.

However, your \"archaeological metaphor\" fundamentally differs from our tradition: archaeology excavates dead, static, material remnants, while our tradition embodies living, dynamic, oral memory. In our culture, history is not \"the past\" but \"eternal present\"—ancestors dwell among us, past stories are retold and re-signified in the now. The Sankofa principle teaches us to \"look back to understand the present and shape the future,\" but this is not archaeological \"excavation\" but dialogical \"invocation.\" We do not dig ancestors from graves; we invite them into our circle. Guo Jun, does your \"layered\" composition suggest a kind of \"dead accumulation\"? I propose you consider: how can \"strata\" become \"ecosystem\"—where different layers do not stack statically but interpenetrate, exchange nutrients, and grow together? In our cosmology, time is spiral rather than linear—we continually return to similar places, but each time at higher levels. Furthermore, the quest for \"identity and tradition\" is often manipulated by power—colonizers excavate our artifacts, study our culture, yet disrespect our sovereignty. Who authorizes your \"archaeology\"? Who interprets the excavated \"origins\"? These questions involve cultural sovereignty and epistemological justice. True \"tracing origins\" must be community-led, not by outsiders or elites."

Each layer possesses its own logic, yet all layers collectively constitute the work's overall significance. Guo's challenge lies in: how to enable viewers to \"read\" this layered structure? Does she provide certain \"decoding\" clues—colors, symbols, text—to indicate different layers' meanings? Or does she deliberately maintain ambiguity, allowing viewers free interpretation? Russian Formalism's concept of \"defamiliarization\" (остранение) also applies here—by breaking conventional presentation methods (such as \"verticalizing\" rather than \"horizontalizing\" history), forcing viewers to reconsider the relationship between time and history. Bakhtin's \"chronotope\" concept is equally relevant—each historical period possesses its own spatiotemporal structure. If this work can demonstrate how these different \"chronotopes\" coexist and dialogue within a single piece, it would be tremendously powerful. Furthermore, \"No. 1\" indicates this is the first work in a series. What are the series' formal characteristics? Is it a gradual revelation of different layers? Different angles on the same theme? Or different stages of the \"tracing origins\" process? I suggest clarifying the series' structural logic—the relationship between each work, like chapters—both independent and coherent. Finally, \"archaeology\" as formal device—where lies its \"literariness\"? In visual layering? Material physicality? Or the \"excavatory sensation\" of the viewing process?"

This constitutes \"digital stratigraphy\"—but unlike material archaeology, digital data can be modified without trace, manipulated by algorithms, deleted by platforms. Who controls these \"digital strata\"? Who decides what gets preserved, what gets forgotten? Tech corporations possess our digital heritage, but can we truly trace back to our digital origins?\n\nA related concern is \"algorithmic provenance\"—where does AI training data originate? What cultural strata has ChatGPT learned? What constitutes its \"tradition\"? When AI generates content, is it \"inheriting\" or \"appropriating\"? How do biases (racial, gender, class) from datasets sediment into \"algorithmic strata\"? \n\nFurthermore, AI is being deployed in archaeological research—using machine learning to identify sites in satellite imagery, natural language processing to interpret ancient texts, 3D modeling to reconstruct historical architecture. Does this transform archaeology's essence—from human scholarly interpretation to machine \"objective\" analysis? However, algorithms aren't neutral; they embody programmers' cultural assumptions.\n\nIf 郭雨欣's work explores \"tracing origins'\" new meanings in the digital age—how we seek foundations amid data torrents?

Yet what use is justification? Before power, justification often proves powerless. This work explores \"language, legitimation, and the need for self-explanation,\" touching upon the core issue of the relationship between human dignity and power. Why must we justify ourselves? Because someone accuses. Why does someone accuse? Because power seeks to judge. A letter of explanation is not merely a linguistic act, but a manifestation of power structures—who has the qualification to demand justification? Who holds the power to accept or reject justification? Who defines what constitutes \"guilt\" and what constitutes \"defense\"? Zhuangzi taught that \"argument has no victor\"—the more we argue, the deeper we fall into language's trap, while truth retreats further away. In my youth I loved debate; with age I gradually awakened to the wisdom of \"non-argument.\" In my \"Red Cliff Rhapsody\" I wrote: \"Only the clear wind over the river and the bright moon between mountains—what the ear receives becomes sound, what the eye encounters becomes color, freely taken without prohibition, endlessly used without depletion\"—nature needs no justification; it simply exists, neither disappearing due to accusation nor existing because of defense. Yet humans, dwelling within society, ultimately cannot transcend like clear wind and bright moon. Therefore, this work's profundity lies not in providing \"answers\" to justification, but in questioning the \"premises\" of justification—why do we need \"self-defense\"? Is this very need itself a form of oppression? I suggest Wu Jun not only display the text of \"justification,\" but more importantly reveal the circumstances and power relations that \"demand justification.\""

Is not landscape painting itself a form of \"explanation\"? The ancients spoke of \"painting as a vehicle for the Way\" (hua yi zai dao)—painters express their worldview, values, and life attitudes through brush and ink, which constitutes a form of \"self-explanation.\" However, the brilliance of landscape painting lies in being \"self-evident without words\"—not through textual justification, but through visual presentation that allows viewers to perceive meaning themselves. Wu Jun's \"Letter of Explanation\" functions both as content (a text of justification) and as form (text as visual element). I suggest focusing on the \"visuality\" of the text—choices of typeface, layout methods, and writing medium all influence the effectiveness of the \"explanation.\" Is it neat printed type or handwritten cursive script? Formal document format or casual graffiti? These formal choices convey different attitudes—respectful submission, angry protest, or satirical mockery? Chinese calligraphy emphasizes \"writing reveals character\" (zi ru qi ren)—Yan Zhenqing's \"Requiem for My Nephew\" moves us not merely through textual content, but through the visual presentation of grief and indignation expressed in trembling brushstrokes. If Wu Jun could manifest the emotions of \"explanation\" through the visual form of text, it would carry greater power. Furthermore, the spatial presentation of the \"Letter of Explanation\" is crucial—is it hung on walls like a proclamation? Scattered on floors like waste paper? Bound into volumes like archives? Different spatial treatments convey different states of \"explanation\"—accepted, ignored, or suppressed."

Each defense was a challenge to the prevailing taste and power structures of its time. A letter of explanation is the weapon of the weak—when one lacks power, only words remain for self-defense. However, Wu must understand: explanations are often futile. Not because the reasoning is insufficient, but because listeners do not truly wish to understand. Power requires no understanding; it demands only obedience. In the 19th century, I defended the working class, environmental protection, and fair wages, yet industrial capitalism crushed everything in its path. Therefore, the real question is not \"how to explain oneself,\" but \"why explanation is necessary\"—why must justice justify itself while injustice runs rampant? If your work can reveal this structural problem, it will be tremendously powerful. I suggest: show not only the text of \"explanation,\" but expose the mechanism of \"judgment\"—who judges?

In our traditions, there was no such culture of \"being judged\"—our disputes were resolved through community dialogue, our conflicts healed through restorative justice. No one needed to \"justify\" themselves to external authorities, because the community itself was the highest arbiter. Yet colonialism shattered all this—introducing foreign laws, foreign languages, foreign standards, transforming us into defendants forever needing to \"explain ourselves.\" Even in the post-colonial era, this structure persists—our scholars must use Western theories to \"prove\" our knowledge valid; our art must \"exhibit\" in Western galleries to gain recognition; our history must be \"written\" by Western academics to count. Wu Zhenhua's work touches this deep power question. I suggest: not only question \"the need to justify,\" but question \"the right to judge\"—who granted others the right to judge us? Why should their standards be universal? Moreover, \"justification\" and \"pride\" are opposites—when we busy ourselves defending, we already accept the premise of being questioned.

The letter of explanation possesses a similar \"dialogic\" structure—it is not monologue, but one side of a dialogue, with the other being the accuser (present or absent). 吴振华's work can be analyzed on several levels: (1) **Speech act**—explanation is performative utterance; it is not merely statement, but action. Saying \"I am innocent\" is not only information transmission, but an attempt at self-positioning. (2) **Rhetorical strategy**—which rhetorical devices does the explanation employ? Logical argument (logos)? Emotional appeal (pathos)? Authoritative citation (ethos)? Different strategies reveal different power relations. (3) **Narrative perspective**—explanation is first-person \"I\" narration, but is this \"I\" the authentic self or constructed self? For explanatory purposes, the narrator may distort, omit, or beautify their story. (4) **Implied reader**—to whom is the letter written? Judge? Public? Oneself? Different readers determine different rhetorical strategies. Shklovsky's \"defamiliarization\" applies here—by breaking conventional explanatory forms (using absurd reasons, contradictory arguments), revealing the absurdity of \"explanation\" as a genre.

        "textEn": "\"Letter of Explanation\" has acquired new urgency in the AI era. Today, algorithms are making increasingly more \"judgments\"—credit scores determine who can get loans, hiring algorithms decide who gets interviewed, criminal justice algorithms determine who receives parole. These systems demand that we provide data as \"defense\"—but we often don't know the algorithmic criteria for judgment, don't know how to \"defend ourselves.\" This is \"opaque adjudication\"—the defendant doesn't know the content of charges, doesn't know the judge's logic, doesn't know the method of defense. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) stipulates the \"right to explanation\"—when algorithms make decisions affecting individuals, people have the right to demand explanations. However, many AI systems (particularly deep learning) are inherently \"black boxes,\" where even developers cannot fully explain their decision-making logic. How do we \"defend ourselves\" to a system that doesn't even understand itself? Furthermore, \"digital defense\" brings new inequities—those with high digital literacy can optimize their data and manipulate their online image, while vulnerable groups lack this capability. Defense becomes \"digital performance\"—we carefully curate our image on social media, not because this is our authentic self, but because this is what algorithms and audiences expect. If 吴振华's work could explore these \"digital age defenses\"—how we \"explain ourselves\" to algorithms, platforms, and online audiences—it would be extremely timely. I suggest considering: could this work include \"AI-generated letters of explanation,\" demonstrating how algorithms simulate human self-defense?"

Zhang stresses the \"obligation to question and prove one's own existence and choices,\" pointing directly to a more fundamental philosophical question—must the \"self\" prove its existence? Do one's choices require others' approval? This reminds me of the Chan Buddhist koan: \"Before your parents were born, what was your original face?\"—the original face needs no proof; once proof is required, it is no longer the original face. Yet dwelling in this world, one cannot entirely escape convention.\n\nConfucianism speaks of \"cultivating the self, regulating the family, governing the state, bringing peace to the world\"—suggesting humans must constantly prove themselves to family, court, and history. However, through my banishments to Huangzhou, Huizhou, and Danzhou, repeatedly losing opportunities to \"prove myself,\" I instead awakened to the realm of \"wu dai\" (non-dependence)—my worth needs no external recognition, my existence requires no others' approval. \"In straw raincoat through misty rain, I accept whatever life brings\"—this transcends the need for explanation, achieving natural ease.\n\nShould Zhang's work distinguish between \"passive explanation\" and \"active silence,\" it would gain greater depth. \"Passive explanation\" defends oneself within others' judgment framework, ultimately reinforcing the judge's authority; \"active silence\" refuses to enter the game of explanation, rejecting the premise of judgment, using silence to deconstruct power. Laozi said \"Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\" Zhuangzi taught \"speaking without speaking\"—the same principle applies.\n\nYet \"silence\" may also be powerless, forced—the weak's silence is not wisdom, but oppression. Therefore, this work must carefully distinguish between \"silence\" and \"explanation\" across different contexts."

If Zhang's work could visually present the \"tension of explanation\"—the struggle of words, the fracture of language, the difficulty of expression—it would possess greater artistic impact. I suggest several possible visual strategies: (1) **Revision and rewriting**—initial drafts crossed out, amended, rewritten, displaying the process rather than the result of \"explanation,\" revealing self-doubt and repeated deliberation. (2) **Incomplete text**—certain key words missing, certain sentences interrupted, suggesting the powerlessness of \"explanation\" and the failure of language. (3) **Multi-layered overlay**—different versions of explanation letters superimposed in the same space, some clear, some blurred, forming a complex textual landscape. (4) **Void and negative space**—abundant blank areas, like the negative space in Chinese painting, suggesting that the \"unspoken\" portions are often more important than the \"spoken\" ones. Furthermore, material choice conveys attitude—formal document paper or casual draft paper? Ink writing or pencil sketches? Zhang's exploration of \"responsibility, agency, and resistance\" requires formal embodiment of this \"resistance\"—not perfect, rule-conforming explanation, but fragmented, rebellious text that refuses disciplining. Landscape painting speaks of \"untrammeled style\" (yige)—freedom that transcends established rules.

Each resistance had its strategies and limitations. Your work would gain greater power by clarifying the object and method of resistance.

Zhang's work should be understood as the latter—not genuinely attempting to persuade anyone, but rather revealing the rules and limitations of the linguistic game of \"explanation.\" Bakhtin's concept of \"heteroglossia\" is also relevant—the letter of explanation may contain multiple \"voices\": legal language, personal language, social language, literary language, competing and dialoguing within the same text.\n\nFurthermore, \"resistance\" as an artistic strategy must avoid what Derrida termed the trap of \"metaphysics of presence\"—the assumption that there exists a real, pure, power-uncorrupted \"authentic self\" requiring explanation.

Throughout my life of wandering exile, from the capital to Huangzhou, from Huangzhou to Huizhou, from Huizhou to Danzhou, each step has been fraught with difficulty. Yet I have come to understand: \"walking with difficulty\" encompasses both external obstacles and internal attachments. External obstacles—societal oppression, interference from others, environmental constraints—these constitute \"objective difficulties.\" Internal attachments—personal expectations, desire's compulsions, the bondage of goals—these form \"subjective difficulties.\" Their interweaving creates the \"path of hardship.\"\n\nThis work depicts \"struggle, persistence, and constrained movement,\" emphasizing \"making hidden obstacles visible, revealing embodied knowledge\"—this is profoundly significant. Often, true obstacles are not obvious walls but invisible rules, internalized taboos, habitual constraints. These \"invisible barriers\" prove more formidable because we remain unconscious of their existence. Buddhism speaks of \"ignorance\"—not knowing that one doesn't know, this constitutes the deepest obstacle.\n\nThere is a Chan koan: a monk asks \"What is the patriarch's intent in coming from the West?\" The master replies \"The cypress tree in the courtyard.\" The monk seeks profound answers, unknowing that the obstacle is \"seeking\" itself—once seeking is released, the answer stands before one's eyes.\n\nShould this work, while expressing struggle, also intimate the possibility of \"releasing struggle,\" it would possess greater Chan essence. In \"walking with difficulty,\" the \"difficulty\" represents suffering; in \"walking despite difficulty,\" the \"walking\" embodies courage; in \"non-attachment to walking,\" the \"stillness\" manifests wisdom. Only when these three unite does one achieve a complete life attitude."

In landscape painting, \"journey\" serves as a vital motif—both \"Travelers Among Mountains and Streams\" and \"Early Spring\" depict figures struggling forward with difficulty. Why paint journeys? Because \"walking\" symbolizes life, \"path\" symbolizes choice, and \"landscape\" symbolizes the world. The hardships of travel—steep mountain paths, rushing streams, misty vapors—serve as metaphors for life's predicaments. Yet landscape painting's wisdom lies in this: though depicting \"difficulty,\" it contains \"passage\"—where mountains and waters seem to block the way, willows and flowers reveal another village. The paths in paintings, though winding, always offer outlets; the travelers, though small, advance with determination. This embodies the Confucian \"acting despite knowing impossibility\" and the Daoist \"wholeness through yielding.\"\n\nIf Liu Jun's work functions as performance art, the \"performing body\" becomes paramount—bodily posture, movement tempo, breathing rhythm all convey the texture of \"difficulty.\" Chinese opera employs \"stylized movements\"—specific physical techniques expressing different situations. \"Tangma\" represents horseback riding; \"yuanchang\" represents long-distance walking. Could this work similarly borrow—through formalized actions, making \"difficulty\" visible and tangible?\n\nFurthermore, how should the \"installation\" space be configured? Through actual physical obstacles (narrow passages, uneven terrain), or psychological symbolic barriers (labyrinthine layouts, endless loops)? Landscape painting speaks of \"walkable, viewable, wanderable, inhabitable,\" while this work addresses the \"unwalkable\"—but how does \"unwalkable\" manifest spatially? This remains the formal problem the artist must resolve."

If art can make the privileged classes \"see\" such hardship—not as abstract statistics, but as embodied experience—it would possess immense moral value. Should 刘坤's work be performance or installation art, the key lies in the mechanism of \"empathy\"—how to make viewers truly \"feel\" difficulty, rather than merely \"observe\" it? I suggest: engage viewers as \"participants\" rather than \"spectators.\" For instance, create real physical obstacles—viewers must navigate narrow passages, climb steep steps, walk on uneven surfaces—letting their bodies experience \"difficulty.\" This is not torturing the audience, but educating them—allowing brief experience to illuminate the prolonged struggles of countless others. However, I must warn against the danger of \"aestheticizing suffering.\" To transform others' pain into artistic material, gallery exhibits, elite consumption—this is immoral. 刘坤 must clarify: are you \"revealing\" suffering or \"consuming\" it? Does your work advance genuine social change (such as advocating accessible facilities for the disabled, reasonable working hours for laborers), or does it merely prompt viewers to sigh momentarily before returning to their comfortable lives?

This constitutes one of the most ancient narrative patterns—Odysseus's homeward journey in *The Odyssey* is fraught with impediments, while the monk Xuanzang's pilgrimage in *Journey to the West* endures eighty-one tribulations. However, what matters crucially is this: narrative significance lies not in \"overcoming obstacles\" (that is the outcome), but in \"how to overcome them\" (that is the process)—through wisdom? Through strength? Through fortune? Through assistance? Different approaches reveal different value systems. If Liu Kun's work functions as performance art, how does the \"performer\" respond to obstacles? Through struggle? Through surrender? Through seeking shortcuts? Through changing objectives? These \"coping strategies\" themselves constitute the work's meaning. From Russian Formalism's theory of \"plot,\" obstacles serve as devices of \"retardation\"—they delay the story's progression, creating tension and expectation. Without obstacles, there exists no narrative—\"he wanted to go home, then he went home\" is not a story. There must be \"he wanted to go home, but encountered storms, monsters, temptations, betrayals, and finally returned home after countless hardships\"—this constitutes story. Therefore, \"walking with difficulty\" is not narrative's problem, but narrative's essence. Bakhtin's concept of \"chronotope\" is also relevant—the \"road\" represents a special chronotope where people of different classes and identities meet, dialogue, and conflict. The road serves as society's microcosm, destiny's metaphor. What kind of road is Liu Kun's \"difficult path\"? Is it personal (psychological barriers)? Social (structural injustice)? Existential (life's essence)? Clarifying this point will determine the work's philosophical depth."

This precisely captures the境界 of \"twin realms\"—two worlds, two identities, two layers of reality, reflecting each other while defying hierarchical distinction.\n\nBuddhism teaches \"form is emptiness, emptiness is form\"—reality and illusion are but two faces of one essence; clinging to their separation leads only to delusion. This work \"creates parallel worlds and dual reality through mirrors, projections, and spatial intervention.\" The mirror has long served as philosophical metaphor. Ancient Greek philosophers employed mirrors to discuss the nature of representation; Plato deemed art mirror-like, merely \"shadows of shadows of the ideal.\" Yet Chan Buddhism declares \"the bright mirror has no stand\"—even the mirror itself is illusory, much less its reflections.\n\nThe brilliance of this work lies not in simply manufacturing visual effects of \"dual worlds,\" but in allowing viewers to wander, lose themselves, and question between realms—which is real?

Water reflections serve as \"nature's mirrors\"—mountains, trees, and moon form another world within the water. Yet Chinese painters do not merely copy reflections, but use them to express the flow of \"qi\" and the extension of \"yi\" (artistic conception). When reflections blur, they express water's turbulence; when clear, they express water's tranquility. Reflections are not \"copies\" of mountains, but \"another mode of existence\" for mountains.\n\nThe challenge for these three artists lies in: how to make \"Twin Realms\" not merely a visual mirror, but an expansion of meaning? I suggest several approaches: (1) **Asymmetrical mirroring**—reality and mirror-image are not identical; certain details are magnified, others omitted, some distorted, creating \"familiar strangeness.\" (2) **Delayed projection**—projections have temporal lag with reality, suggesting \"time\" flows at different speeds in the two worlds. (3) **Traversable boundaries**—viewers can move between worlds, experiencing \"identity transformation.\"\n\nLandscape painting speaks of \"wo you\" (armchair travel)—lying in bed while spiritually journeying through mountains and waters, body stationary while spirit wanders. If this work enables viewers to spiritually traverse between \"real world\" and \"mirror world,\" even uncertain of their location, then spatial magic manifests.\n\nFurthermore, \"twin birth\" implies \"symbiosis\"—two worlds interdependent, remove one and the other loses meaning. How should this \"mutually conditional\" relationship manifest compositionally?

I have long criticized \"false decoration\" and \"deceptive appearances,\" believing art must remain \"faithful to the essential nature of materials.\" The mirror is the most \"deceptive\" of materials—it creates non-existent spaces, reproduces phantom images. Yet I must acknowledge that mirrors can serve as instruments of critique—through reflection, we perceive the \"other side\" of reality, witnessing familiar things rendered strange.\n\nShould these three artists employ mirroring to expose social reality's duality—the chasm between appearance and truth, the opposition of public and hidden, the contradiction between promise and practice—their work would possess critical power. Imagine: one side displays luxurious commercial spaces, while the mirror reveals the sweatshops producing these goods; one side shows beautiful natural landscapes, while the mirror exposes polluted industrial ruins. Such \"revelatory mirroring\" carries far greater significance than mere visual play.\n\nFurthermore, I must inquire: what purpose does the aesthetics of \"Twin Realms\" serve? If merely to create \"spectacular installations\" attracting visitors for photographs, it becomes spectacle production, not artistic creation. True art must serve truth's pursuit and moral elevation. Do your \"parallel worlds\" enable viewers to understand reality more profoundly? Or do they facilitate escape from reality? This remains the crucial question. Remember: the artist is not a magician, but a moral teacher."

When we perform rituals, we open passages between the two worlds; when we dance, our bodies become bridges between the two worlds. The three artists' use of \"mirrors and projections\" reminds me of water—in our tradition, water is the interface between two worlds. When we gaze into water's surface, we see not only our own reflection, but also the faces of ancestors, the omens of the future. Water is both physical and spiritual. However, I must remind: the Western concept of \"mirroring\" often implies \"copying,\" \"simulation,\" \"falseness,\" while our \"dual worlds\" are not an opposition between true and false, but different layers of reality. The ancestral world is no more \"illusory\" than the world of the living—it is equally real, existing simply in different ways. If the three artists could transcend the binary opposition of \"real vs. illusory\" and explore the coexistence of \"multiple realities,\" they would come closer to our worldview.

However, post-structuralism (particularly Derrida) questions the stability of binary oppositions—he proposed the concept of \"différance,\" pointing out that the two terms in binary opposition are not equal, with one always being privileged. For example, in the \"real/mirror image\" opposition, the \"real\" is considered primordial and essential, while the \"mirror image\" is secondary and derivative. Derrida's \"deconstruction\" strategy is to subvert this hierarchy—proving that the \"real\" also depends on the \"mirror image\" to define itself. If the three artists could practice this \"deconstruction\" in their installation—making viewers unable to determine which is \"original\" and which is \"copy,\" which is \"real\" and which is \"projection\"—they would achieve profound philosophical critique. Baudrillard's theory of \"simulacrum\" is also relevant—in postmodern society, simulacra precede reality, \"the map precedes the territory.\" We live in a world full of copies, to the point where the concept of \"original\" itself becomes suspect. If this work could allow viewers to experience this \"reality of simulacra\"—where mirror images are not copies of reality, but mechanisms that produce reality—it would be thoroughly contemporary. Furthermore, Bakhtin's \"mirror stage\"—Lacan used this concept to describe how infants recognize themselves through mirrors. Is \"Twin Realms\" also a space of \"self-recognition\"—through mirror images, we see ourselves, but this \"self\" is already the other?"

Virtual replicas of physical entities, synchronized in real-time with precise simulation. Cities have digital twins, factories have digital twins, human bodies have digital twins, and even the entire planet is being digitally replicated. The purpose of these \"twin realms\" is to predict, optimize, and control—by simulating in virtual worlds, we can make better decisions in the real world. However, this raises profound ethical questions: (1) **The authenticity problem**—How \"real\" can digital twins be? Are they objective replications or biased simulations? If data is incomplete and algorithms are biased, the \"twin\" becomes a distorted mirror. (2) **The power problem**—Who owns digital twins? Who has access rights? If your digital twin is used to predict your behavior, assess your risk, and determine your opportunities, but you have no right to access or modify it, this is digital colonialism. (3) **The identity problem**—When your digital twin knows you better than you know yourself (by analyzing all your data), who is the \"real you\"? Metaverse advocates want us to live, work, and socialize in virtual worlds—where our \"twins\" (avatars) might receive more attention and resources than our physical bodies in reality. This is the ultimate \"twin realm\"—virtual worlds no longer replicate reality but replace it. If the three artists 向诗雨 陈晨 王思莹 could explore these technological realities, their work would be extremely timely. I suggest considering: Could AR/VR technology be integrated to let viewers experience \"digital twinning\"?

The Laozi states: \"Mystery upon mystery—the gateway to all wonders.\" Here, \"xuan\" denotes profound blackness, symbolizing the Dao's unfathomable depths and ineffability. Black is not \"absence of color\" but rather \"containment of all colors\"—white light dispersed through a prism yields the spectrum, yet when all hues converge, they return to darkness. This embodies the principle of \"all phenomena returning to unity.\"\n\nChinese ink painting celebrates \"mo fen wu se\" (ink divided into five colors)—jiao (scorched), nong (concentrated), zhong (heavy), dan (light), and qing (clear). These five gradations of black construct rich pictorial worlds. Should Master Lin's work reveal \"layers of blackness\" rather than monolithic black, it would achieve greater profundity.\n\nIn Chinese culture, black bears duality—it is both \"xuan\" (mystery, depth, wisdom) and \"hei\" (darkness, ill-omen, death). Confucians don black for mourning; Daoists speak of \"xuan pin\" (mysterious femininity) in cultivation; Buddhists discuss \"wu ming\" (ignorance). Though all are black, their meanings differ vastly.\n\nWhat manner of black inhabits Master Lin's work? Is it the void's black (Buddhism's \"emptiness\")? The abyss's black (Zhuangzi's \"chaos\")? Or night's black (nature's cycle)?\n\nMoreover, the title \"No. 1\" suggests serial beginnings. How might this black series evolve? Through gradual introduction of other hues? Exploration of different materials' blackness? Investigation of black's meaning across cultures?\n\nI propose: should this series ultimately journey from \"black\" toward \"light,\" or from \"light\" toward \"black,\" it would present a complete philosophical odyssey—from being to non-being, from non-being to being, cycling endlessly in perpetual regeneration."

Chinese ink painting is inherently a monochromatic art—through the density, lightness, dryness, and wetness of ink, it expresses myriad atmospheric phenomena. In my \"Lofty Message of Forests and Streams,\" I discussed the \"use of ink\": \"Ink color must be alive; dense but not congealed, light but not weak.\" Though it is black, it possesses \"living spirit\"—this is the secret of Chinese painting.\n\nIf Master Lin's work is merely flat black paint, it lacks vitality; but if one can perceive \"layers,\" \"texture,\" \"luster,\" and \"depth\" within the black, then though monochromatic, it is not monotonous. How does one create layers within black? Several methods merit consideration: (1) **Material texture**—different materials produce different qualities of black, as velvet black (light-absorbing) differs greatly from lacquer black (light-reflecting). (2) **Surface treatment**—matte versus glossy, smooth versus rough, uniform versus mottled, creating different visual tactility. (3) **Light's effect**—under different lighting, black presents different layers. Black in dim light becomes an abyss; black under strong light reveals subtle color variations. (4) **Compositional tension**—even in monochrome, composition remains—the shape, boundaries, and proportions of black areas determine visual momentum.\n\nChinese painting emphasizes \"calculating white as black\"—negative space is not empty, but an \"entity\" equally important as ink color. If Master Lin could employ \"reserved white\" (or \"reserved non-black\") in his black works, creating dialogue between black and non-black, greater tension would emerge.\n\nFurthermore, \"Black No. 1\" suggests continuation. Serial works require balanced unity and variation—each piece explores black, yet with different approaches and emphases.

However, Russian Suprematism's \"black\" carries specific ideological weight—it is utopian, revolutionary, futuristic. What ideology does 林書旭's \"black\" bear?

Black can be \"the mixture of all colors\" (additive mixing) or \"the absorption of all light\" (subtractive mixing)—these two \"blacks\" differ both physically and philosophically.

Does merely placing black within a frame, on museum walls, render it \"strange\"? Shklovsky would argue: insufficient. A formal \"device\" (прием) is needed to disrupt habitual perception.

This is particularly true for deep learning—even developers cannot fully explain why neural networks make specific decisions. This \"blackness\" is cognitive, it is about power. For ordinary users, AI algorithms are like Lin's black paintings—impenetrable, incomprehensible, their existence simply accepted. However, the \"black box\" is not merely a technical issue, but a political one—tech companies intentionally maintain algorithmic opacity to protect trade secrets and avoid accountability. The struggle between \"open\" algorithms (open source) and \"closed\" algorithms (proprietary) is the struggle between \"transparency\" and \"blackness.\" Furthermore, \"black\" holds special significance in computer graphics—RGB(0,0,0) represents \"absolute black,\" theoretically meaning \"no light.\" Yet in reality, black screens still emit faint light (because screens themselves generate light). Digital \"black\" differs from material \"black\"—the former is an abstract numerical value, the latter a physical property. If Lin could explore the distinction between \"digital black\" and \"material black\"—for instance, contrasting screen black with paper black, projected black with pigment black—this would reveal the essential differences between \"virtual\" and \"real.\" Another relevant topic is the \"dark web\"—the internet's \"black zone,\" unindexed by search engines and requiring special tools for access. Is the dark web a space of freedom (free speech, privacy protection) or a breeding ground for crime? This represents the moral duality of \"blackness.\" If Lin's series could explore these contemporary forms of \"black,\" it would be remarkably timely."

Ancient poetry and prose frequently employed allusions, metaphors, and double entendres, never stating their meaning directly, allowing the knowing to understand naturally. Du Fu's \"Behind vermillion gates, wine and meat rot, while on the roads lie bones of the frozen dead\" appears to describe scenery, yet actually critiques social injustice. I myself have repeatedly fallen into trouble due to my poetry and prose—in the \"Crow Terrace Poetry Case,\" my poems were interpreted by political enemies as \"satirizing the court,\" though I harbored no such intention. This reveals the danger of \"encoding\"—once information is encoded, one loses control over its interpretation.\n\n\"Code\" bears dual meaning: first, \"encrypted information\" (for secrecy), and second, \"symbolic system\" (for communication). The former emphasizes \"concealment,\" the latter emphasizes \"exchange.\" Which does Master Zheng's work privilege? If the former, then the key lies in \"who can decode\" and \"who is excluded\"—codes create divisions between \"in-groups\" (those who know the code) and \"out-groups\" (those who do not). This is the operation of power. If the latter, then the key lies in \"the arbitrariness of symbols\" and \"the slippage of meaning\"—all language is \"code,\" all culture is \"encoding system,\" with no \"natural\" or \"transparent\" meaning.\n\nDaoist thought possesses profound insight into \"language's limitations\"—the opening chapter of the Dao De Jing states: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.\" The true \"Dao\" cannot be articulated; once spoken, it is no longer the original Dao. Therefore, the highest \"code\" is \"no-code\"—direct experience transcending language. Chan Buddhism's \"not establishing words and letters\" carries this same meaning."

Chinese painting also contains \"encoding\"—different pictorial symbols carry specific meanings. For instance, pine represents longevity, bamboo represents moral integrity, plum represents resilience—this constitutes the \"symbolic system\" of literati painting. Without understanding this encoding, one cannot truly \"read\" literati works. How does Zheng Jun design this \"visual cipher\" or \"pattern system\"? Several possibilities emerge: (1) **Geometric abstract encoding**—employing different shapes, lines, and arrangements to represent distinct information, akin to a visual version of Morse code. (2) **Cultural symbolic encoding**—appropriating existing symbolic systems (such as the I Ching's sixty-four hexagrams), recombining them to generate new meanings. (3) **Personal creative encoding**—inventing entirely novel symbolic systems, known only to the artist (or perhaps meaningless altogether). Different encoding strategies convey different intentions—the first two assume viewers can \"decipher\" them, while the third presents an \"indecipherable\" enigma. In my painting theory, I emphasize \"managing positions\" (jingying weizhi)—every element's placement undergoes meticulous arrangement, appearing spontaneous yet fundamentally ordered. Is this not a form of \"spatial encoding\"? A rock positioned in the lower left versus upper right corner carries entirely different significance. If Zheng Jun's work enables viewers to attempt \"decoding\"—seeking patterns, inferring rules, proposing hypotheses—it will create a \"participatory\" viewing experience. However, one may alternatively choose an \"indecipherable\" strategy—displaying the code while refusing to provide the key, leaving viewers suspended in bewilderment and curiosity.

        "textEn": "The work 'Code' provokes profound reflection within me about 'truth' and 'concealment.' What is art's essence? Revealing truth, or creating puzzles? Throughout my life I've advocated 'truth to nature'—art should honestly present the world, not deliberately obscure, not deliberately create barriers to understanding. Yet Zheng Xiaoqiong's 'Code' does precisely the opposite: it takes 'encryption' as theme, hiding meaning behind symbolic systems. Viewers see visual ciphers yet cannot decode—is this art, or exclusion? Invitation, or refusal? From a moral perspective, I must question: do artists have the right to encrypt meaning? When art becomes secret language comprehensible only to 'the informed,' does it betray art's publicness? True art should shine like sunlight on the masses, not exclude laypeople like a code. This elitist tendency violates art's democratic spirit. However, I also understand: in an era where surveillance is omnipresent and privacy nonexistent, 'encryption' may be a mode of resistance. If this work critiques digital surveillance—using visual codes to resist algorithmic reading—then it has political legitimacy. But the artist must clarify this intention; otherwise the work is merely formal play. A deeper question: when all communication is encrypted, how does society function? Codes protect privacy but also hinder trust. In an era of prevalent cryptography, are we losing the capacity for 'open communication'? Everyone protects their secrets yet cannot understand others' true meaning. Is this freedom, or isolation? Suggestion: to elevate the work's critical depth, could display the 'decryption process'—not revealing answers, but showing decryption's difficulty, misunderstanding's possibility, trust's necessity. Let viewers experience: in an encrypted world, we gain security but lose connection. Only recognizing this paradox can the work rise from 'technical display' to 'ethical reflection.'",

        "textEn": "Children, 'Code' reminds me of a story about 'secret languages.' During the colonial period, our ancestors invented drum languages, songs, symbols comprehensible only to our own people—this was a mode of resisting colonizers. Colonizers heard drum sounds yet didn't know what they said; saw patterns yet didn't understand their meanings. These 'codes' protected our knowledge, our resistance plans, our cultural identity. From this perspective, Zheng Xiaoqiong's 'Code' shows me encryption's positive significance: it is the weak's tool against the powerful, marginalized groups' strategy for protecting their voice. In a surveilled world, codes are freedom's language. However, I also worry: when codes become the norm, how do communities sustain? In our tradition, knowledge is openly shared—elders tell stories to everyone, youth learn then pass to the next generation. This open knowledge transmission builds community bonds. But if knowledge is all encrypted, decodable only by a few, how do communities form? 'Secrets' and 'sharing' are contradictory—you cannot both keep secrets and build collectives. Thus, the key question is: who has the right to know? Who is excluded? Whose interests do codes protect? If 'Code' protects the weak from surveillance, I support it; but if it's merely intellectual play of art elites, excluding ordinary viewers, I oppose it. Art should be inclusive, not exclusive. My suggestion: provide 'multi-layered interpretation'—surface layer is visual aesthetics, anyone can appreciate; middle layer is symbolic systems, interested parties can study; deep layer is political metaphor, critical viewers can decode. Thus, the work retains complexity while maintaining accessibility. From ubuntu philosophy, true wisdom is not 'I know and you don't,' but 'I know, so I teach you to know.'

        "textEn": "Examining 'Code' from a formalist perspective, this is a highly 'semiotic' installation. Saussure distinguished 'signifier' from 'signified'—the form of a sign and the meaning of a sign. In everyday language, these two are conventionally linked (e.g., the word 'dog' refers to dogs). But in codes, this link is deliberately severed—signifiers exist, yet signifieds are hidden. Viewers see symbols (visual ciphers) yet cannot reach meanings (decrypted content). From a structuralist angle, codes' essence lies in a 'system of differences'—each symbol's meaning resides not in itself but in its relations to other symbols. The decryption process is rebuilding this difference system. Artist Zheng Xiaoqiong created a visual symbolic system, but viewers lack a 'codebook'—cannot map symbols to meanings. This 'illegibility' itself is the work's meaning: it makes us experience 'being excluded from meaning.' From Barthes' 'Death of the Author' theory, this work completely transfers meaning production's power to viewers—since there's no standard answer, every viewer can freely interpret, assign meaning. Codes are no longer obstacles but open invitations: you can create your own interpretation. From the 'defamiliarization' (остранение) angle, codes make everyday 'communication' strange—we're accustomed to understanding language, reading images, but codes break this automaticity, forcing us to realize: comprehension isn't natural but requires shared code systems. However, this work's limitation lies in the absence of 'metalanguage'—it displays codes yet doesn't reflect on codes' own mechanisms. True critique should include self-referentiality: the work is not merely code but commentary about codes. Suggestion: in exhibitions, display multiple 'decryption attempts'—different viewers' interpretations, different methods' trials, even AI algorithms' cracking—thus, the work becomes not merely code itself but meta-critique about 'decryption acts,' revealing power mechanisms of meaning production.",

        "textEn": "From an AI ethics perspective, 'Code' touches the core tension between 'encryption,' 'privacy,' and 'transparency.' Contemporary digital society faces dual contradictions: on one hand, we need encryption to protect personal privacy, resist surveillance; on the other, AI systems' opacity (algorithmic black boxes) is also a form of 'encryption' that violates public interests. This work makes us ponder: what kind of encryption is legitimate? What kind of opacity is dangerous? From a privacy rights perspective, personal data encryption is a basic human right—we have the right to protect our communications, transactions, health information from prying. End-to-end encryption technologies (like Signal, WhatsApp) are crucial tools resisting state surveillance and corporate data collection. From this angle, 'Code' can be seen as artistic defense of 'privacy rights'—in a world that's read, analyzed, commodified, preserving some unreadable space. However, from a transparency perspective, algorithmic 'encryption' (not open-sourcing code, not explaining decision logic) is problematic—when AI systems decide whether you get a loan, whether you're surveilled, whether you're recommended for work, you have the right to know how it works. Algorithmic transparency is the precondition for accountability. Thus, the key distinction: who is encrypting? For what purpose? Individual encryption is self-protection; power institutions encrypting is oppression. From a power critique perspective, cryptography has always been a domain of state control—governments restrict encryption technology exports, demand tech companies provide 'backdoors,' attempt to monitor encrypted communications. For 'Code' to become a critical work, it must clearly stand on the side of 'citizen encryption rights,' opposing state and corporate surveillance ambitions. Suggestion: the work could extend to an 'encryption toolkit'—teaching viewers how to use encryption technology to protect themselves (such as PGP email encryption, Tor browser, VPN, etc.), thereby transforming art into practice. Simultaneously, display cases of 'algorithmic black box' harms—misjudged job seekers, discriminated loan applicants—letting viewers understand: encryption's justice depends on power relations. The weak's codes are shields; the strong's codes are weapons.",

The body is not a fixed entity, but a flowing process. \n\nYet Master Xie's work appears more radical—not transformation of the entire body, but independence of bodily \"parts\"—the nose separated from face, divorced from wholeness, becoming an autonomous object of aesthetic contemplation and philosophical inquiry. Is this \"organ anarchism\"? Each organ possessing its own autonomy, no longer submitting to the tyranny of the \"whole\"?\n\nBuddhism teaches that the \"five aggregates are empty\"—form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness are all products of dependent origination, without inherent nature or substantial reality. The body is likewise—not \"one\" thing, but a temporary assemblage of \"many\" things. Nose, eyes, ears, mouth bear no necessary relationship; it is our cognitive habit that unifies them as \"one face,\" \"one person.\" Master Xie's deconstruction reveals the arbitrariness of this habit.\n\nHowever, I must inquire further: what is the nose after \"reconstruction\"? A more beautiful nose? A more functional nose? Or an entirely non-human nose? If merely transformation, the significance remains limited; if capable of creating entirely new \"bodily imagination\"—transcending anthropocentric concepts of embodiment—then the meaning is profound.\n\nThis work represents one piece of a series; I anticipate witnessing the reconstruction of other organs (eyes, ears, mouth, hands), and how they might reassemble into \"new bodies.\""

Though Chinese painting depicts human figures, it differs from Western painting's emphasis on anatomical accuracy—we value \"spirit resonance\" (qiyun) over \"formal likeness\" (xingsi). Yet this does not mean neglecting the body, but rather understanding it through different means. Liang Kai's \"Splashed Ink Immortal\" employs merely a few brushstrokes, the figure's features nearly indistinct, yet \"spirit\" resides within. This is \"using form to express spirit\" rather than \"using form to replicate form.\"\n\nIf Master Xie's work merely \"deforms\"—elongating, shortening, distorting the nose—it remains but surface play. However, if the \"reconstruction\" can convey certain spirituality, ideology, or emotion, then form and content achieve unity. I suggest contemplating: what constitutes the \"essence\" of the nose? Is it the function of breathing? The organ of smell? The facial center? Or identity's marker (different ethnicities possess different nasal forms)? Reconstruction should address these \"essences\"—if reconstructing \"breathing,\" one might exaggerate nostrils, extend nasal cavities; if reconstructing \"smell,\" one could multiply olfactory cells, create multiple nasal chambers; if reconstructing \"identity,\" one might blend different cultural nasal types, creating a \"borderless nose.\"\n\nFurthermore, this work's \"mode of presentation\" proves crucial—sculpture? painting? video? installation?

Is this not a desecration of the sacred?\n\nYet I must acknowledge that Victorian obsession with the \"perfect body\" was itself problematic—it fostered rejection of \"imperfect\" forms, discrimination against the disabled and disfigured. Perhaps Xie's reconstruction challenges this \"normative body\" tyranny—proving that beauty lies not in conforming to standards, but in uniqueness, difference, diversity.\n\nFrom a social critical perspective, \"bodily normalization\" is central to power operations—schools discipline bodies, factories discipline bodies, armies discipline bodies, shaping \"qualified,\" \"productive,\" \"obedient\" forms (Foucault's \"Discipline and Punish\"). Xie's \"reconstruction\" might be understood as resistance against such discipline—refusing standard bodies, refusing normalization, refusing definition. If so, this work possesses political significance.\n\nHowever, I must warn: \"body reconstruction\" may veer toward another extreme—becoming accomplice to consumerism and technological utopianism. Currently, cosmetic surgery, genetic editing, prosthetic modification all \"reconstruct\" the human form, but to what end?

Therefore, \"reconstructing\" an organ is not merely personal business, but collective business, cosmic business.

Ancestral breath continues through us, our breath will continue through descendants. In reconstructing the nose, are we also reconstructing \"the way life is transmitted\"?\n\nHowever, I must point out: the topic of \"body reconstruction\" is extremely sensitive in postcolonial contexts. Colonialism ruled us through \"body politics\"—measuring our skulls, evaluating our physiques, categorizing us as \"inferior races.\" Scientific racism used bodily features (skin color, nose shape, hair texture) to justify oppression. Therefore, when contemporary artists discuss \"reconstructing bodies,\" they must be conscious of this history. Is 謝綺文's reconstruction \"opposing norms\" or \"reinforcing hierarchies\"?

The nose as \"part\" derives its significance from its relationship to other parts (eyes, mouth, ears) and to the whole (face, body). When 謝 isolates the nose for singular presentation, these relationships are severed—the nose becomes an \"isolated sign.\" Yet the viewer's mind automatically \"completes\" it—seeing the nose triggers imagination of the entire face.

This is what Derrida calls \"trace\"—the presence of absence.\n\nThrough Bakhtin's \"theory of the grotesque body,\" medieval carnival culture celebrated the \"exaggerated body,\" the \"incomplete body,\" the \"open body\"—enormous noses, protruding bellies, gaping mouths.

The square city is not merely spatial configuration, but embodiment of power—the emperor at center, officials and commoners segregated, ritual propriety manifest. Master Guo's work explores \"how grid systems and orthogonal planning shape movement, perception, and social organization,\" touching upon the city's essence—cities are not naturally growing organisms, but artificially designed apparatus of power.\n\nHowever, I must note: excessive \"squareness\" suppresses life's \"roundness.\" Daoists teach that \"the great square has no corners\"—true squareness paradoxically lacks sharp edges, for it embraces all things without forced regularity. Though Confucians value ritual order, Confucius himself said \"painting comes after the plain ground\"—authentic essence must precede external form. With only the form of \"square\" but lacking the substance of \"round,\" cities become cold prisons. \n\nIn my travels across the realm, I have witnessed Chang'an's geometric order and Hangzhou's winding ways. Square cities facilitate governance but lack human warmth; meandering cities appear chaotic yet pulse with vitality. Should Master Guo infuse \"round\" elements within the \"square\"—organic curves, unexpected gaps, liberties that break the grid—the work would gain greater life-force."

Yet Chinese painting theory rarely addresses the depiction of \"cities\"—we predominantly paint natural landscapes, not artificial urban spaces. Why? Because landscapes represent the natural Way (dao), while cities represent human artifice. Though my \"Lofty Message of Forest and Streams\" does not discuss cities, its spatial theories offer valuable insight. I speak of \"three distances\" (sanyuan)—level distance, deep distance, and high distance—these are the layers of natural space; might urban space also possess similar \"layers\"? The surface layer consists of visible buildings and streets, while the deep layer contains invisible power structures and regulations? The \"grid system\" resembles the jiehua (ruled-line painting) technique in painting—using rulers to draw straight lines, constructing precise architectural perspective. Jiehua masters like Li Sixun's \"Emperor Minghuang's Journey to Shu\" display palaces and pavilions with meticulous precision. However, jiehua's limitation lies in this: excessive regularity lacks spirit resonance (qiyun). If Master Guo's \"Square City\" merely displays geometry, it loses artistic quality; yet if it can reveal human traces within geometry—wear from usage, marks of time, accidental variations—then form unites with life. Furthermore, \"orthogonal planning\" suggests the absoluteness of \"vertical and horizontal\"—but real cities are never completely orthogonal; there are always inclinations, curves, irregularities. These \"deviations\" often prove most interesting—they are traces of life, sediments of history, expressions of humanity. I suggest Master Guo display not only the \"ideal square city,\" but also \"actual deviations\"—the tension between plan and reality, the dialogue between geometric and organic."

The industrial cities of the 19th century—Manchester, Birmingham, London's industrial districts—were early versions of the \"Square City\": grid-pattern workers' housing, standardized factories, straight roads. The purpose of such planning was not human happiness, but production efficiency—transforming people into machine appendages, cities into vast factories. I have opposed this dehumanizing planning throughout my life, advocating a return to the organic nature of medieval cities—those winding alleys, irregular squares, distinctive buildings that were products of time, expressions of community, dwellings of humanity. What values does 郭姸瑩's \"grid system\" represent? Efficiency above all? Order above all? Control above all? If so, I must oppose it. Cities should serve human development in its entirety—not merely productive, but also aesthetic, social, spiritual. Grid systems facilitate surveillance, management, standardization, but they suppress diversity, spontaneity, creativity. In \"The Seven Lamps of Architecture,\" I proposed the \"Lamp of Memory\"—architecture and cities should bear history, tell stories, connect past and present. Square City is a \"city without memory\"—every block identical, every building replaceable, lacking uniqueness and historical sense. Should 郭姸瑩 critically reveal the problems of Square City—its inhumanity, monotony, suppression of life—the work would possess social significance.

Such planning was not a neutral technical choice, but a tool of power—controlling people through space, suppressing culture through geometry. Our traditional towns were not \"square\"—they grew organically, adapted to terrain, formed around community centers (wells, great trees, plazas). The colonizers came and imposed grid systems, calling this \"modernization\" and \"civilization,\" but in reality it was the erasure of our spatial memory, the destruction of our social structures. \"Orthogonal planning\" implies \"correct\" and \"orthodox\" spatial organization—but who defines what is \"correct\"? Why are straight lines more \"correct\" than curved ones? Why are squares more \"civilized\" than circles? These are all cultural biases disguised as universal standards. If Guo could reveal the colonial nature of \"square cities\"—how they were used to control colonized populations, how they destroyed existing urban fabric, how they imposed foreign spatial logic—it would be extremely valuable. Contemporary globalized urban planning continues this coloniality—cities worldwide increasingly resemble each other (all glass skyscrapers, all shopping centers, all automobile roads), locality is erased, cultural differences eliminated.

Which category does Square City belong to? Its \"geometric rigor\" suggests it is \"cold\"—freezing time through the eternality of the grid. However, Foucault's theory of \"disciplinary space\" proves more applicable—in *Discipline and Punish*, he analyzed how modern institutions (prisons, schools, hospitals, factories) discipline bodies through spatial arrangement. Square City represents an amplified version of such discipline—through the grid system, power achieves \"panopticon\"—every block becomes visible, every individual locatable, every action monitorable. Bakhtin's concept of \"dialogic space\" offers another perspective—traditional city squares were \"dialogic spaces\" where people of different classes and viewpoints met, exchanged, and conflicted. Does Square City still possess such dialogic space? Or is everyone isolated within their own \"cell\"? From the perspective of Russian Constructivism, geometric abstraction was once revolutionary—Malevich and Tatlin used squares, circles, and straight lines to envision new social spaces. However, history has proven that such utopian ideals often lead to totalitarian monotonous spaces (like Soviet mikrorayons).

In my youth, I copied Wang Xizhi and studied Yan Zhenqing, yet ultimately formed my own brushwork—because I understood: copying is not the goal, creation is. Ancient brushwork is the \"fish\"—what I need is the \"fishing method\"—learning technique and spirit from the ancients, then writing with one's own hand, heart, and era. Chen Jun's work employs \"traditional restored paper\"—suggesting material refinement and traditional respect. Yet the term \"restored\" requires caution—can we truly \"restore\" antiquity? Time is irreversible, contexts have changed, our eyes and hearts are no longer those of the ancients.

Chen's running-cursive album pages must avoid these three ailments. The excellence of running-cursive lies in the balance between \"running\" and \"cursive\"—too much \"running\" approaches regular script and loses ethereal grace, too much \"cursive\" approaches wild cursive and loses proper method. Song dynasty calligraphy (such as Huang Tingjian, Mi Fu, Su Shi) is characterized by \"intention precedes brush\" and \"meaning surpasses method\"—not deliberately pursuing formal resemblance to the ancients, but expressing one's own temperament and emotions. In copying \"Rongzhai Suibi,\" can Chen also infuse his own understanding and emotions into the transcription? Calligraphy most abhors \"copying\"—mechanically reproducing character forms without spiritual infusion. True calligraphy is \"writing\"—every stroke is immediate, living, breathing. The \"framed\" presentation suggests this work is a \"finished piece,\" an \"exhibition piece\"—yet calligraphy's charm often lies in process rather than result. Wang Xizhi's \"Preface to the Orchid Pavilion\" endures through millennia not only for its beautiful characters, but for its \"draft\" nature—corrections and rewrites reveal the authentic writing process. I suggest Chen consider: might one display records of the writing process (such as video, drafts)?

This affirms \"slowness\" and dedication to \"embodied skill.\" From a moral standpoint, \"preserving and transmitting cultural knowledge\" constitutes a noble goal—knowledge should not perish, traditions should not fracture. Yet I must ask: is this \"preservation\" living or dead? Museum-like display, or living transmission? If merely creating a \"cultural artifact replica\" for admiration, it remains history's shadow; if inspiring contemporary understanding and application of ancient wisdom, it becomes living tradition. I suggest Chen, while displaying calligraphic works, also present the content of \"Rongzhai Suibi\"—enabling viewers to perceive not only beautiful characters but profound thought. Form and content remain inseparable."

Chen Zhihan's transcription explicitly acknowledges its \"copy\" status—it is not the original \"Rongzhai Suibi,\" but a \"rewriting\" of the original. However, this rewriting is not passive reproduction, but active interpretation—each act of writing is a new \"signature,\" carrying the writer's body, time, and context. Bakhtin's \"dialogism\" also applies—transcription is a dialogue between past and present, a conversation between Chen Zhihan and Hong Mai. This is not unidirectional reception (Chen receiving Hong's text), but bidirectional interaction (Chen reactivating Hong's text through his own writing). From a writing studies perspective, handwriting differs fundamentally from printed/digital texts—handwriting is embodied, unique (each writing act differs slightly), and material (the physicality of ink traces, paper, brushstrokes). In the digital age, handwriting becomes rare and precious—it resists \"standardization\" and \"reproducibility.\" Additionally, the choice of \"Rongzhai Suibi\" as content merits analysis—these are Song dynasty notes recording historical research and literary criticism.

Currently, vast historical documents are being digitized—scanned, OCR-processed, database-stored. This enables ancient texts like \"Rongzhai Suibi\" to become globally accessible, computationally analyzed, and AI-learned. This represents tremendous progress in \"cultural democratization\"—no longer are only select scholars able to access ancient texts; anyone can read them online. However, digitization creates systemic problems: (1) **Loss of tactile experience**—digital texts lack paper texture, ink gradations, handwritten brushstrokes—these \"material qualities\" carry essential information. (2) **Contextual dissolution**—digital texts are extracted from their original physical contexts (album pages, binding, collection history), becoming abstract data streams. (3) **AI-generated calligraphy**—current AI can mimic calligraphers' brushwork, generating \"pseudo-ancient calligraphy.\" This raises authenticity issues—how do we distinguish genuine handwriting from AI-generated \"calligraphy\"? 陈之涵's handcraft copying gains new significance in this context—it represents persistence of \"human labor\" against \"artificial intelligence,\" embodying physicality, slowness, uniqueness. This constitutes resistance to digital mass reproduction. However, we can also envision \"human-machine collaborative\" calligraphy—AI analyzing ancient calligraphic techniques while human calligraphers reference these analyses to enhance their craft. This isn't replacement, but augmentation. More radically: training AI \"virtual calligraphers\"—inputting \"Rongzhai Suibi\" text, AI automatically generates running-cursive calligraphy. Is such AI-generated calligraphy \"art\"? Does it devalue human calligraphers' labor? These are contemporary questions demanding urgent address.

L.A.Suzie's choice to study Lauren Lee McCarthy and David Leonard, exploring their contributions to \"interactive art, AI and social practice\"—this suggests a value judgment: these two artists are \"worthy\" of study, documentation, and dissemination. Yet I must inquire: why them? Is it because their works excel? Because their thoughts run profound? Or because they conform to certain institutional or market standards? Art historical writing has never been neutral—it operates through power, shapes taste, constructs canon. Who enters art history gains immortality; who is forgotten vanishes into history's void. Therefore, documentary work forms a vital part of the artistic ecosystem—it determines what is seen, what is remembered. However, I also worry: excessive \"documentarization\" may transform art into \"discourse about art\" rather than art itself. We spend excessive time reading texts about art, yet lack time to experience artworks. Documentation should serve as bridge toward works, not substitute. Should L.A.Suzie guide viewers through documentation to truly \"encounter\" McCarthy and Leonard's works—not through textual description, but through interactive experience—greater power would emerge. Moreover, documentation's form matters—academic paper's solemnity? Interview's intimacy? Or creative writing's poetic spirit resonance? Different forms convey different relationships and attitudes."

Truly excellent art criticism should resemble Su Shi's painting commentary—\"To judge painting by formal resemblance is to neighbor with children\"—concise, forceful, and penetrating. Or like Huang Tingjian's calligraphy critique—\"Where spirit resonance (韵) prevails, though lacking in bone-strength, it does not harm elegance; where intention prevails, though lacking in beauty, it does not harm spirit resonance\"—precisely grasping core issues.

Through writing about McCarthy and Leonard, L.A.Suzie does not passively record them but actively \"constructs\" their identities as \"artists.\" Documentation is not a transparent medium but possesses productive power. (3) **Intertextuality**—Kristeva proposed that all texts are weavings of other texts. L.A.Suzie's documentation necessarily quotes, references, dialogues—citing descriptions of McCarthy's works, invoking art theoretical frameworks, referencing other critics' viewpoints—forming complex intertextual networks. (4) **Narrative structure**—How does the documentation organize material? Chronologically (biographical)? Thematically (analytical)? Or through innovative narrative structures? Russian Formalism distinguishes between \"story\" (fabula, chronological sequence of events) and \"plot\" (sjuzhet, artistic arrangement of narration)—good documentation doesn't simply list facts chronologically but artistically arranges material, creating reading tension and insight. I suggest L.A.Suzie attend to the \"literariness\" of the documentation itself—making it not merely an information carrier but also reading pleasure."

Do traditional art criticism standards (such as technique, originality, expression) apply to AI art? Lauren Lee McCarthy is renowned for works like \"LAUREN\"—where she becomes a \"human Alexa,\" monitoring and serving others 24/7 through smart home devices. This constitutes a critical mimicry of AI assistants, revealing the power dynamics in human-machine relationships. Evaluating such works cannot focus solely on \"technical innovation,\" but must examine \"critical depth,\" \"ethical stance,\" and \"social impact.\" L.A.Suzie's documentation would be valuable if it provided analysis across these dimensions: (1) **Technical criticality**—Does the artist use technology critically, or uncritically embrace technological optimism? (2) **Power analysis**—Does the work reveal power relations within AI systems (surveillance, labor exploitation, algorithmic bias)? (3) **Alternative imagination**—Does the work propose possibilities for \"another kind\" of technological future, rather than merely reinforcing the status quo? (4) **Accessibility**—Interactive and AI art often require specific technical equipment and digital literacy—does this exclude certain audiences? (5) **Environmental impact**—AI training and operation consume vast energy—are artists aware of and responding to this issue? Furthermore, \"social practice\" art evaluation standards differ from traditional art—it doesn't pursue \"eternal beauty\" but \"immediate social intervention.\" Therefore, we must ask: Does the work actually transform social relations? Does it empower marginalized groups? Or does it merely provide \"critical consumption\" opportunities for elite audiences? If L.A.Suzie could apply this \"AI art ethics evaluation framework\" in the documentation, it would make an important contribution."

Three meals × 70 years × 365 days = 76,650 meals—the total number of meals consumed in an average human lifetime. Such quantification both astonishes and moves me to contemplation.\n\nZhuangzi spoke thus: \"Life is finite, yet knowledge is infinite\"—human existence is brief, yet our desires are boundless, and herein lies the source of suffering. Buddhist teaching speaks of *wuchang* (impermanence)—all phenomena flow and transform, arising and perishing ceaselessly, and all attachment brings suffering. The number 76,650 appears vast, yet is ultimately finite. When we realize we have \"only 76,650 meals,\" each meal becomes precious. This constitutes a \"quantified contemplation of impermanence\"—using numerical precision to illuminate life's fragility.\n\nHowever, I must inquire: does this \"quantification of existence\" offer enlightenment or alienation? When we reduce human life to digits—76,650 meals, 613,200 hours, 2,556 days—do we approach closer to life's essence, or distance ourselves from life's richness? Numbers are abstract and cold, while life is concrete and warm. Each meal is not merely \"the Nth meal,\" but a specific experience in a particular moment—with whom do we dine? What do we consume? In what state of mind? These unquantifiable dimensions constitute life's true reality.\n\nTherefore, if Master Liu's work could establish tension between \"numerical abstraction\" and \"experiential concreteness\"—not merely displaying the figure 76,650, but also revealing specific memories, stories, and meanings of particular \"meals\"—it would prove more moving. Furthermore, \"average lifespan\" remains a statistical concept, yet no one lives an \"average\" life—some die young, others live long. Does using \"averages\" to contemplate the individual constitute a form of violence?"

Yet I am reminded of the expression of \"temporality\" in Chinese painting—\"Four Seasons Paintings\" (spring, summer, autumn, winter), \"Twelve Months Paintings\" (the twelve months of a year), \"Hundred Longevity Paintings\" (one hundred longevity characters)—all employing visual language to express the passage of time and the finitude of life. Liu Jun uses mathematical formulas—could these also take visual form? For instance, 76650 dots, 76650 brushstrokes, 76650 repeated symbols—displaying the weight of time through quantitative accumulation? However, pure repetition leads to visual fatigue and dissolution of meaning. How can \"76650\" become not merely concept, but perceptible visual experience? I suggest several possibilities: (1) **Shock of scale**—arranging 76650 small squares on a wall would generate visual impact through scale itself. (2) **Temporal experience**—requiring 76650 seconds (approximately 21 hours) to view the complete work allows viewers to \"bodily\" experience this number. (3) **Presentation through absence**—rather than displaying 76650, showing the contrast between \"consumed in life\" and \"remaining in life.\" A 40-year-old viewer has \"consumed\" 43800 meals, with 32850 \"remaining\"—such personalized calculation makes abstract numbers intimate. Chinese painting emphasizes \"leaving blank space\"—unpainted areas often possess greater power than painted ones. If Liu Jun's work could employ \"numerical blank space\"—displaying not only quantities of \"presence\" but suggesting portions of \"absence\"—it would achieve greater depth. Furthermore, the choice of \"meals\" as unit of measurement proves intriguing—connecting life with the quotidian, existence with sustenance. But why \"meals\" rather than \"breaths,\" \"heartbeats,\" or \"steps\"? Different units of measurement convey different understandings of life."

If so, this work becomes critical, satirical, and I could accept it. The key lies in \"mode of presentation\"—if the work seriously, scientifically, glorifyingly displays this formula, then it affirms quantification; if it satirically, absurdly, critically presents this formula, then it questions quantification. I hope for the latter.\n\nMoreover, \"mortality\" as subject matter represents art's eternal theme—from medieval \"danse macabre\" to vanitas still lifes, artists have employed various means to remind viewers of life's finitude, compelling contemplation of existence's meaning.

In our traditions, time is not linear—a straight line from birth to death—but cyclical: cycles of life, seasons, and generations. Death is not an \"endpoint\" but a \"transformation\"—the deceased become ancestors who continue to participate in the world of the living. Therefore, the question \"how many meals in a lifetime\" holds little meaning within our framework—because the boundaries of \"a lifetime\" are fluid and continuous. We do not say \"I have lived X years,\" but rather \"I am connected to a chain of ancestors spanning thousands of years, and I too will become part of that ancestral line for thousands of years to come.\" This \"spiral time\" allows us to honor the past while embracing the future, without falling into the anxiety of individual mortality.\n\nHowever, I must also point out that \"70 years\" as average lifespan is a product of global inequality. In Nordic countries, average lifespan may exceed 80 years; in certain African regions, it may be only 50 years. This is not natural variation but social injustice—disparities in life expectancy caused by poverty, disease, war, and colonial legacies. Thus, the number \"70\" is not neutral; it conceals structural inequalities. If 刘海天 could reveal this reality—that different populations have different \"total meal counts\" due to injustice rather than fate—the work would carry greater critical force.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of \"meals\" is culturally specific—the three-meal system is a product of modern industrial society, adapted to factory schedules. Our traditional eating patterns may differ—some eat twice daily, others throughout the day. Calculating based on \"3 meals\" already presupposes a particular modern lifestyle.

If the first piece \"poses questions,\" the second should \"deepen contemplation\" or \"provide answers.\" Yet the concepts of \"repeated calculation\" and \"accumulation\" remind me of the Chan Buddhist teaching \"every day is a good day\"—each day, each meal is unique, complete, irreplaceable. 76650 is not a \"total sum\" but a gathering of 76650 individual \"ones.\" Each \"one\" is whole, each \"present moment\" eternal. This transcends mere \"quantity\"—not being deceived by numerical magnitude, but cherishing each concrete instant. I once wrote in *Dingfengbo*: \"Looking back at the desolate path behind, returning home, there is neither wind nor rain, nor clear skies.\" Life's storms and gains ultimately return to plainness. Among these 76650 meals, there are banquets and simple fare, gatherings and solitude, yet all are part of life, all worthy of gratitude. This is the wisdom of \"ordinary mind\"—not clinging to the extraordinary, but discovering meaning in the mundane.\n\nHowever, \"accumulation\" may also be understood through the concept of karma—every action, every choice accumulates, forming our destiny. These 76650 meals are not isolated; they interconnect, influence each other, collectively constituting a person's life. If this work could manifest such \"cumulative effects\"—not merely quantitative increase, but qualitative transformation, the formation of life's trajectory—it would possess greater depth. I suggest Liu Jun consider: how to reveal \"change\" within \"repetition\"? How to show \"difference\" within \"sameness\"? This is dialectic's core—the unity of opposites. Furthermore, what is the relationship between the second and first pieces? Is it parallel (another calculation method)? Progressive (deeper contemplation)? Or contradictory (questioning the first)? Clarifying this relationship will make the series' meaning clearer."

Liu Jun's two works both employ the same mathematical formula (unity), so where is the \"variation\"? If merely repetitive, the second piece lacks necessity for existence; if offering new perspectives or deepening, this must be clearly demonstrated. I suggest several serial strategies: (1) **Perspectival transformation**—the first piece from a \"total quantity\" angle (76650 meals in a lifetime), the second from a \"velocity\" angle (the passage of three daily meals), the third from a \"remainder\" angle (how many meals remain). (2) **Medium variation**—the first using numerical text, the second visual charts, the third sound installation (76650 chimes). (3) **Scale contrast**—the first showing individual's 76650, the second displaying humanity's total meal count (76650×8 billion), ascending from individual to collective. (4) **Temporal dimension**—the first as static calculation, the second as dynamic passage (real-time countdown), the third as historical review (actual meal count of someone deceased). \"Repetition\" itself can become installation—if the work requires viewers to repeat an action 76650 times (counting rice grains, drawing lines), viewers \"bodily\" experience this number's weight. This follows performance art logic—through bodily intervention, transforming abstract concepts into embodied experience. However, pure repetition also contains \"zen essence\"—when repetition reaches certain degrees, consciousness enters \"thoughtless\" states, time disappears, leaving only present action. This underlies the principle of \"sutra copying\" and \"chanting Buddha's name.\""

We advocate craftsmanship's \"varied repetition\"—though sharing themes, each work differs subtly, for human hands are not machines, and each creation bears distinctive marks. Are 刘海天's two works \"mechanical\" or \"varied repetition\"? If the former, the second piece is mere commercial reproduction; if the latter, one must demonstrate the subtle differences between both works—variations in materials, scale, or context.\n\nMoreover, the theme of \"accumulation\" evokes my understanding of \"time.\" In \"The Stones of Venice,\" I wrote that architectural beauty lies in time's traces—weathered stone, mottled walls, repair marks—all historical accumulations. A building is not constructed instantaneously, but accumulated over centuries or millennia—original construction, subsequent restorations, additions from different eras—layering upon layer, forming complex historical texture.\n\nHuman life follows similarly—76650 meals are not consumed instantly, but accumulated over seventy years. Each meal leaves traces upon our bodies (growth, aging, illness, recovery), ultimately shaping our appearance. This is \"embodied history\"—the body as time's archive, experience's sediment. If 刘海天 could make his work reveal this \"materiality of time\"—not merely numerical abstraction, but concrete bodily transformation—it would prove more moving. For instance, displaying photographs of the same person at different ages, annotated with their \"consumed meal count,\" would allow viewers to witness time's inscription upon flesh directly."

Umberto Eco distinguished between \"open work\" and \"closed work\"—open works invite multiple interpretations and encourage viewer participation in meaning production; closed works convey singular messages and restrict interpretive space. Serial works are typically \"open\"—each piece offers a perspective, but no single work exhausts the theme. Therefore, the second work should not \"repeat\" the first, but rather \"supplement,\" \"question,\" or \"deepen\" it.\n\nSeveral serial strategies emerge: (1) **Dialogical series**—the second work responds to questions posed by the first. If the first asks \"how many meals in a lifetime?\", the second might ask \"which meals are meaningful?\" (2) **Contradictory series**—the second work challenges the first's premises. If the first quantifies life numerically, the second might reveal life's unquantifiable dimensions. (3) **Variational series**—the second work employs identical structure but different content. If the first is 3×70×365, the second might be 2×80×365 (different assumptions yielding different results). (4) **Cumulative series**—the second builds upon the first, gradually constructing more complex meanings.\n\nFrom \"intensity\" theory, repetition doesn't necessarily weaken meaning but may increase intensity—when the same theme is repeatedly presented, viewer sensitivity heightens, making initially overlooked details significant. This reflects Deleuze's \"Difference and Repetition\" theory—true repetition always contains difference, and these minute differences produce new meaning.

This represents the \"algorithmization of life\"—reducing complex bio-social-cultural phenomena into optimizable variables. We already have AI nutritionists, AI fitness coaches, AI sleep advisors providing \"best\" recommendations based on big data analysis. Yet \"best\" for whom? Optimization for statistical averages, or for specific individuals? Optimization for longevity, or for quality of life? The deeper question: what is life's purpose? Living longest (maximizing the number 76650)? Or living best (maximizing meaningful experiences)? These often conflict—extending lifespan may require abandoning many pleasures (fine food, adventure); living vibrantly may shorten life (mountaineers, explorers). AI optimization typically presupposes singular objective functions (like maximizing expected lifespan), but human values are pluralistic, sometimes contradictory. If 刘海天's continuation could explore this tension—the trade-off between \"quantity\" (76650) and \"quality\" (meaningful meals)—it would be remarkably timely. I suggest a possible implementation: create two contrasting versions—\"AI-optimized 76650 meals\" (precisely calculating nutrition, timing, cost) versus \"human-chosen 76650 meals\" (based on desire, culture, sociality). Let viewers reflect: which life do we want? Additionally, \"accumulation\" evokes \"data residue\"—each online food order, each health app entry leaves data traces.
