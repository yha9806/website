        "content_en": "\"A Northeasterner's coming-of-age ritual is a southbound train ticket\"—this line struck me deeply. This handmade book is not documenting the Northeast, but writing a ritual of departure. Each page turned is like scenery flashing past a train window: water towers, Nanhu Park, childhood photos... They are no longer places, but anchors in time. The artist wraps modern nostalgia in traditional binding—this itself is a contradiction: we use ancient methods to preserve things that are disappearing."

        "content_en": "Han Xue is right, but I want to approach from another dimension: what moves me most about this book is its five-sense structure. The artist didn't choose linear narrative, but organized content through memory, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and vision. This is an anthropological classification. Think about it: the lullaby \"The Moon is Bright, the Wind is Calm,\" the fragrance of Dandong strawberries, the sweet-and-sour of Guobaorou, the touch of ice and snow—these cannot be captured by visual archives. The body remembers more than the eyes. When we say \"I miss home,\" we're not thinking of images, but of sensations."

Yet I believe its most precious quality lies in its \"unfinished meaning.\" Poetry in painting, painting in poetry—this book is the same. Photography and text merge, yet don't explain each other, but leave space for each other. For instance, \"The Northeast is not just a geographical location, but also a psychological state\"—this phrase has flavor beyond flavor. As I once said, \"To judge painting by form alone is to see like a child.\" This book seeks not resemblance but spiritual resonance—the spirit of the Northeast lies not in mountains and rivers, but in where the heart finds peace."

This is how Northeasterners express themselves—no beating around the bush, no fancy words. The artist uses the \"slow\" medium of handmade books to carry this \"direct\" emotion, creating an interesting tension. In an era of rapid movement, we use the most traditional methods to remember the most simple things."

        "content_en": "Han Xue's mention of \"slow\" makes me think of this book's materiality. Traditional Chinese book binding—thread-bound, rice paper, hand-folded—is itself a tactile experience. Readers must turn pages by hand, feeling the thickness and temperature of paper. This is completely different from scrolling through Northeast vlogs on phones. The artist deliberately chose a medium requiring bodily participation—this is resistance to the digital age, and insistence on \"slow memory.\" Frozen pears need to thaw slowly to taste good; memories also need to unfold slowly to have flavor."

        "language": "zh",
        "content_en": "Li Mei speaks of \"slow\" and \"touch,\" and I deeply agree. When I was exiled to Huangzhou, I often recalled the mountains and waters of Sichuan, yet what I remembered was not shapes and colors, but the sound of wind in bamboo groves, the coolness of streams. This book is the same: the artist doesn't seek to fully recreate the Northeast, but gathers fragments that most touch the five senses. The blank spaces between fragments are where viewers can fill in their own memories. A good book doesn't make you forget after reading, but allows you to \"continue\"—to extend the unfinished meaning with your own experience. This book has this quality—it has grasped the true essence of art."

Sparrows were listed as one of the four pests, mobilizing nationwide extermination—the Northeast was no exception. A year later, pests lost their natural predators, causing massive crop damage. This is a history selectively forgotten. The artist choosing sparrows as subject is summoning a ghost—that species erased by policy error, along with the ecological balance and human dignity that disappeared with it. The thick texture of oil painting aptly carries this weight of history."

Our generation scattered south like sparrows, leaving that land. But sparrows have a homing instinct—what about us? The artist painted four sparrows, perhaps representing four seasons, four directions, four fates. The sparrows on canvas are silent, yet seem to be waiting for something—waiting for spring, waiting to go home, waiting to be seen again. This is not just historical painting, but a portrait of nostalgia."

        "content_en": "You both approach from history and emotion; I'll speak from painting theory. Though this painting uses Western oil techniques, it has the spiritual quality of Chinese bird-and-flower painting. Ancient painters depicted sparrows not for resemblance, but to \"capture life\"—capturing vitality, spirit, life itself. Though these four sparrows are still, they have a gazing power, as if examining the viewer. Song dynasty painters said \"birds gain meaning and forget form\"—this painting is the same: the sparrow's form may be simplified, but its loneliness, stubbornness, its unyielding spirit, leaps from the canvas. This is a work where both \"form\" and \"spirit\" are complete."

This cross-cultural position gives her a unique way of seeing—both internal memory and external reflection. She uses oil painting—a Western medium—to paint sparrows—an Eastern image. This displacement itself is the embodiment of diaspora experience. Sparrows fly in the context of globalization, yet always yearn for that black earth covered in frost and snow."

Small scale means close viewing—the viewer must approach, lean in, to see the sparrow's feathers and eyes. This is an invitation, also a requirement: to understand this history, you cannot observe from afar, you must get close. The pain of diaspora can only be felt when you get close enough."

Ancient critics said paintings should be \"walkable, viewable, wanderable, livable.\" This painting cannot be viewed from afar, but can be gazed upon long—gaze long enough, and the birds seem to speak. When I painted bamboo, I said \"have the complete bamboo in your chest\"—not meaning the bamboo's form is in one's chest, but its meaning is in one's heart. This painting is the same: though sparrows are small, the historical memory they carry, the pain of diaspora, the longing for home—all are within. Small painting, great meaning—this is what it means. Let us all reflect on this."

Shenyang is the most typical industrial city in the Northeast; Tiexi District was once Asia's largest industrial zone. A family's trajectory in this city often closely matches the city's industrial cycle: entering factories during industrial prosperity, laid off during decline, leaving during contraction. Private history and urban history are two sides of the same coin. The artist using archival methods to present family memory is actually writing a micro-urban history—behind every work ID is a cross-section of an era."

You've tasted the sweet-sour of frozen pears, you know the crisp sound of candied hawthorn, you remember the white breath in winter—these unforgeable bodily experiences are the truest identity proof. The artist \"hides\" them in objects, waiting for the right person to \"decode.\""

Ideas easily breed argument; senses are hard to deny—who can deny winter's cold, rice's fragrance, silk's smoothness? These sensory experiences transcend politics. Northeast Asia's future may lie not in who agrees with whom, but in whether we can together feel the same snowfall, the same wind, the same starry sky. This work is a beginning."

Perhaps that \"directness\"—wood is wood, iron is iron, snow is snow. This directness crosses borders, finding resonance throughout the region."

Oral history is a special sensory archive: it relies on sound, tone, pauses, sighs... things text cannot fully capture. When Grandma tells stories of her youth, her voice trembles, rises, becomes distant—these are all part of the narration. If Shuyi Alice Wang preserves these sounds' \"raw state\" in the work, it would be more moving than any written record. Sound is another material form of memory."

        "content_en": "Li Mei says \"sound is memory's material form\"—this is precisely the griot's belief. In our tradition, stories must be transmitted through voice, because only voice can carry soul. Writing is dead, voice is alive—it changes with the teller's emotion, with the listener's response. Shuyi Alice Wang collecting family oral histories is like me collecting village stories. We're both guardians of memory, using voice to resist forgetting. Each telling is a small resurrection."

        "content_en": "Mama Zola says \"resurrection\"—this word makes me think of family stories' intergenerational transmission. My grandmother told her story, my mother grew up listening; my mother told her story, I grew up listening; when I have children, I'll tell my story. But the question is: each transmission has loss and addition; ultimately what remains? Shuyi Alice Wang's work is perhaps a kind of \"rescue\": recording stories not yet transmitted, preventing them from disappearing forever with elders' passing. This is a kind of love, also a responsibility."

        "content_en": "Han Xue mentions \"rescue\"—this makes me think of this work having no pictures. Perhaps for oral history, pictures are secondary—what matters is sound, language, the teller's breath. Our dialogue is also a kind of oral narration: we're using language to describe a work we haven't seen, creating an \"imagined exhibition\" based on text. This echoes oral history's essence: it doesn't rely on visual evidence, but on language's power. Shuyi Alice Wang's work, even without pictures, has already been \"exhibited\" in our dialogue."

In our griot world, each listener's mental image is different—because we only provide sound, the picture is drawn by listeners themselves. Shuyi Alice Wang's family oral history is the same: she provides voice and story, each viewer rebuilds that family, that history, those people in their own mind. This is participatory art: viewers are not passive receivers, but active co-creators. Every family story is unique, but every story-listener can see their own family in it. This is the magic of oral transmission."
