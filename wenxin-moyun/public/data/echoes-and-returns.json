    "description": "The Whistled Valley (2025) is a 20-minute Ambisonic sound composition exploring Silbo Gomero, the whistled language of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. Presented in 3rd-order Ambisonics (16-channel spatial audio), the work is designed for immersive playback in multichannel speaker arrays, inviting audiences to experience the echoes of a vanishing oral tradition.\nDeveloped during a two-week field trip on La Gomera in June 2025, the project combines location recordings, interviews, and participatory listening sessions with Silbo Gomero speakers and educators. These materials, together with the island’s environmental soundscapes, form the basis of the composition.\nStructured around poetic narration, fragmented testimonies, and reconstructed acoustic environments, the piece highlights both the affective and archival dimensions of a language at risk. Silbo Gomero is not only a communicative tool but also a sonic marker of cultural identity and intergenerational memory. By embedding its fragile presence within immersive spatial sound, The Whistled Valley invites listeners to engage with the emotional and historical weight of this unique human expression, standing as a call to listen, remember, and protect intangible heritage before it disappears into silence.\n\nPlease note: The Whistled Valley was originally composed in a 16-channels Ambisonic format, intended for playback through a dedicated loudspeaker setup to fully reproduce the spatial experience. For accessibility and review purposes, a binaural rendering of the work is provided via the link. This version is for headphone listening only, as it preserves the distinctive spatialisation and immersive qualities of the original multichannel composition.",

In her project \"Picky Eater,\" a visceral dissection of childhood eating trauma, she transforms abstract emotions—such as suffocation, burnout, and disgust—into perceptible, concrete digital forms by creating sensory experiences that are at once familiar and profoundly unsettling. Her work serves not only as a process of personal memory but also as a sharp response to universal human vulnerabilities and systemic issues, aiming to provoke strong emotional resonance and critical thought from the viewer.\n",

    "description": "Picky Eater is an experimental digital video work that delves into the family power dynamics and psychological trauma stemming from childhood memories of picky eating. Rooted in the artist's personal experience, the work translates the suffocating feeling of a love administered 'for one's own good' and the anguish of being force-fed into a visceral and unsettling audio-visual language.\nThrough organic visuals generated in TouchDesigner that simulate vomit and decaying food, combined with oppressive family recordings and a distorted soundscape, the work constructs a psychological space poised between memory and nightmare. Within the video, the juxtaposition of cold electronic screens against slick, raw meat symbolizes the conflict between a bodily perception alienated by technology and a primal, visceral revulsion.\nUltimately, Picky Eater is not merely a recollection of personal trauma but a profound interrogation of the blurred boundary between 'love' and 'control.' It compels the viewer to reconsider actions, performed in the name of love, that can inflict intangible harm upon an individual.\n",

    "profile": "As a fashion designer and artist from China, my creative practice is deeply shaped by the dialogue between Eastern philosophy and Western aesthetics. After completing my BA in Womenswear Design at London College of Fashion in 2024, I continued to explore the intersection of materiality and cultural identity during my Graduate Diploma in Fashion & Textiles at the Royal College of Art in 2025. This journey has now led me back to LCF, where I am pursuing an MA in Fashion Design Management, seeking to expand my understanding of how creative vision can evolve into sustainable systems of value.\n\nMy design language emerges from an intuitive conversation between tradition and experimentation. Rooted in my oriental heritage, I often draw from Chinese talismanic symbols, mythic imagery, and natural materials—such as clay, metal, and stone—to create wearable pieces that carry both spiritual and tactile resonance. I see fashion as more than a visual form; it is a vessel of cultural storytelling and emotional energy.\n\nTo me, fashion design is like a lotus leaf—anchored in my cultural roots yet freely floating between disciplines, mediums, and meanings. Through this balance of grounding and transcendence, I hope to build a creative practice that bridges the poetic and the practical, the spiritual and the modern.",

    "description": "Rooted in the Taoist and Confucian concept of Tian Ren He Yi (天人合一) — the harmony between humanity and nature — this project examines the delicate balance between the natural and the artificial in contemporary life. Drawing on the Five Elements philosophy of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, the work explores how these forces shape both the physical and spiritual dimensions of existence, continually cycling through creation and decay.\n\nAlongside these classical cosmologies, the project draws inspiration from the animistic traditions of the Bai ethnic group in China, whose nature worship practices emphasise the spiritual vitality of mountains, rivers, and stones. It also incorporates references to Jiama culture — the ritual art of printed talismans used for protection and communication between the human and the divine. By translating these vernacular spiritual symbols into modern design language, the work aims to reenergise their significance in a contemporary, global context.\n\nIn today’s technologically accelerated era, where our relationship with nature is increasingly strained, Harmony in Disconnection reimagines how these ancestral philosophies might help us re-evaluate our material and spiritual connection to the natural world. Through the integration of clay, stone, and metal into garment structures and sculptural forms, the work blurs the boundary between the organic and the artificial. Each piece becomes a meditation on coexistence — where material, body, and spirit intertwine, and where ancient ecological wisdom finds new resonance through contemporary fashion practice.",

    "description": "Blessed Market is an immersive theatrical experience featuring interactive installations and live performances. Designed for two audiences at a time, this 15-20 minute experience is set in a \nfictional market rooted in Chinese speculative folklore. It introduces Vase Girl and Screen Girl, who act as both narrators and AI-driven performers, inviting participant into a spooky environment layered with interaction: exploring the space, talking with characters, choosing how to respond whether through feeding, touching, and offering, or by learning through ritualised tutorials.These interactions shift the experience from passive observation to co-creation, where audience responses actively shape the unfolding story. \n\nOver eight months of exploration and experimentation, we developed multiple prototypes across concepts, technologies, and fabrication, engaged with audiences through six public showcases, and continuously refined the work based on feedback from diverse participants. Feedback shows emotions build gradually with all elements connected to form continuity. \n\nBlessed Market stages the intimacy between AI and humans as uncanny and unstable. The two characters speak to participants, embodying fragments of the story world through installations. This creates the illusion of agency, prompting audiences to relate to AI not as mere tools but as beings with their own identities. \n \nThis project explores how the unpredictability, anthropomorphism, and surveillance of artificial intelligence reflect dynamics of intimacy and manipulation. It also provokes participants to consider whether the intimacy between AI and humans is a projection of our own desires or the emergence of a new relationship between human and non-human entities.

    "description": "The form of this work originates from the frog worship in Yang-shao culture, reinterpreting and reconstructing mythology in a contemporary, deliberately structured way. Myth is not a static archetype, but something continuously reinvented, appropriated, and projected under changing historical conditions. The image and power of the East Asian creation goddess Nüwa, as civilization shifted toward a patriarchal narrative, became embedded within a kinship and marital framework of mutual dependence with Fuxi—thus, through layers of historical storytelling, the goddess transformed from a frog into a serpent-bodied being.\n\nI chose clay—an ancient material that has endured since prehistory—as the primary medium of narration. It reminds us of the fragility and transience of all stories. I regard the act of creation as both reconstruction and speculation: through the accumulation, repetition, and transformation of clay, new relationships and spaces emerge. Filling and hollowing, imitation and inheritance, extension and deviation occur simultaneously. Like the ancient coiling technique itself, the process comes full circle—returning, at last, to its beginning. ",

As she watches the performance, she finds herself transported into an unknown land in which she encounters a mysterious friend who becomes her source of strength and support, helping her to find a way back home.\n\nThe comic was inspired by my recent trip to Indonesia where I had the opportunity to reconnect with my family there, teaching me about the countries folklore and stories behind their traditional dances.",

    "description": "Nostalgic narratives that traverse time and place lie at the heart of Zhenghan Huang’s practice.\n\nIn The Waves Return, she revisits her childhood holidays by the seaside in her hometown in China and reflects on her more recent experiences along the British coast. Drawing upon early photographs and home videos taken by her parents, Huang reactivates these intimate records as personal archives, vessels of memory where distance and identity quietly intertwine. In Huang’s words, “My mind generates new images from the past. To further explore this dynamic, I returned to the coastal area of my upbringing this past summer.”\n\nThe work also touches upon the traces of absence and the fragility of memory. Through rephotography and the act of revisiting, Huang reconstructs moments from her past that blur the line between documentation and imagination. The seaside becomes a site for examining how memory functions, shaped by distance, repetition, and time. By translating personal recollections into visual form, she reflects on how individual memory connects to broader experiences of place, belonging, and cultural transition.",

    "description": "What is an island made of?\nParadoxically, it is the surrounding water that completes the island. What defines the island lies not within, but outside of it.\n\nThinking of the flowing waters that trace the island’s edges, I often imagine myself turning into water. In that stillness, the island feels like a delicate life gently held within me, like a fetus resting in the sea of myself.\n\nPerhaps the island is not isolated but deeply entangled with the sea. When the island and the sea reflect, absorb, and dissolve into one another, the island becomes a space where opposites coexist: birth and death, solitude and connection, drifting and anchoring.\n\nFrom this symbolic interplay, I imagined a fictional island: EvanescentSusurrus. The name combines “Evanescent” (fleeting) and “Susurrus” (a soft whisper). It is a quiet refuge for beings suspended between presence and disappearance.\n\nOver a month, I visited Spanish islands and interviewed people I met by chance. Their voices, dreams, images, sounds, collected materials, and writing fragments gradually converged into one evolving story.\n\nI asked islanders to share memories, secrets, and personal experiences. Some imagined the island as a living being, describing its scent, form, and voice. Others envisioned becoming nonhuman, wondering how they might perceive the world, relate to humans, and what they would long for if they never returned.\n\nThis project gathers physical and symbolic fragments from real islands. Like stars forming a constellation, these voices connect to create the imaginary island EvanescentSusurrus.\n\nIn the work, shaped by the image of water, visitors encounter these fragments and form their connections. If Narcissus once saw himself in the water, we now meet reflections of others, including nonhuman beings.\n\nIslands are no longer fixed forms. Like drifting lands breathing with the sea, may we each become a quiet, free-floating fragment gently moving through the world.",

Drought, sandy textures, high salinity, and low organic matter limit nutrient and water retention, while alkaline conditions further reduce productivity, leaving farmers reliant on rainfall.\n\nCommunities draw resilience from environmental cycles and spiritual traditions, especially the annual Bun Bang Fai Rocket Festival, which invokes Naga, the mythical serpent of rain and fertility.\n\nThis project reinterprets the ceremonial rocket using indigenous rice husks from local mills and farming communities. Rich in silica and repurposed through craft processes, the husks support a circular, regenerative approach that benefits ecosystems, preserves traditional rice varieties, and honors cultural heritage.\n\nThrough pyrolysis, rice husks can also become biochar, enhancing soil structure, moisture retention, and long-term fertility. Returned to the fields after the symbolic rocket launch, rice husk silica and biochar act as regenerative agents, linking ritual, material, and ecology while restoring soil vitality.",

He is particularly concerned with the shifting position of ordinary individuals within social structures under the dominance of grand technological narratives.\n\nCanhe’s trajectory has recently moved from the position of a critical observer to that of an active constructor. He advances the speculative framework of temporary alliances between “ordinary humans” and “ordinary machines”—a counter-hegemonic imagination that challenges the monopolization of creativity and agency by technological elites. This concept is being developed textually and will be tested through practice, as Yang seeks to confront the intensifying dynamics of digital colonialism and technological hegemony in the globalized present.\n\nHis practice spans a wide range of media—from installation and sculpture to interactive systems—reflecting a refusal to be confined by disciplinary boundaries. Beyond his artistic production, Yang has provided digital art services for leading institutions including Adidas International, the National Museum of China, Alibaba, and Cosmo magazine. In 2022, he became a contracted digital artist with Output. Currently, he directs R&C Design Studio, an experimental design practice exploring how generative AI intersects with material culture to reimagine the mechanisms of cultural heritage reproduction.\n\nCanhe is also active in pedagogy and knowledge exchange. He has taught as a visiting lecturer at the Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, delivering courses on GenAI-enabled cultural heritage innovation and technologically driven art and design. He is now affiliated with the School of Creativity and Innovation at Xiamen University, where he supports the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) teaching team in courses on media art, spatial narratives, and design foundations.\n\nIn both practice and theory, Canhe’s work insists on making visible the infrastructures and ideologies embedded in contemporary technologies, while opening speculative pathways toward more egalitarian human–machine futures.",

This heavy, unresponsive body stands as irrefutable evidence that AI is not “in the cloud,” but deeply rooted in matter, labor, and planetary extraction.\n\nThrough sculpture, animation, and investigative mapping, the work transforms data extraction into an act of remembrance. It listens to the echoes of resources, myths, and generations—inviting viewers to confront technology not as immaterial progress, but as a living, earthly memory.",

    "profile": "My practice is rooted in a profound connection to the natural world, where I explore the entangled relationships between landscape, memory, and emotion. Currently focusing on transformed geographies of the fens, I investigate how land altered by human intervention becomes a site for both ecological tension and personal reflection. These shifting geographies operate as emotional cartographies—mapping grief, joy, loss, and resilience.\n\nThrough painting, I examine how systems of power and patriarchy have shaped both environment and identity. Reclaimed and eroded terrains offer metaphors for challenging structures of control, while also inviting more fluid, reciprocal ways of relating to place. My work proposes that ancient knowledge lingers in the land—in silty residues, ghost rivers, and unseen traces—waiting to be listened to rather than extracted.\n\nWalking, writing, and sketching on-site inform a studio process driven by material curiosity. I work across media, layering, scraping back, and rebuilding, allowing the paintings to unfold intuitively. Embracing ambiguity and material agency, I seek to create contemplative spaces that resist resolution and invite attunement.\nMy research draws on object-oriented ontology, ecological theory, and feminist philosophy, with influences including Jane Bennett, Tim Morton, and Gilles Deleuze. I explore the Anthropocene not just as an environmental condition but as a psychological one, asking what becomes possible when we relinquish the need to dominate.\n\nBio:\nI returned full-time to my practice in 2022 after a career in business. I hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Fine Art from the Royal College of Art (2024) and an MA in Fine Art from Falmouth University (2025), both awarded with distinction. Recently completing an MA in Painting at RCA, I was shortlisted for the 2025 Valerie Beston Award. I have exhibited in London and Cambridge, including a 2024 solo show at Safehouse 2, and my work is held in private collections.\n",

    "description": "This diptych, The Passage of Time explores a semi-abstract landscape rendered in a restrained, monochromatic palette. The work draws on the language of gesture—scratches, brushstrokes, and scored marks—made through layers of oil paint and cold wax on linen. These surfaces record both presence and absence, the visible and the obscured, much like the land itself.\n\nThe composition evokes a terrain shaped by time and touch, altered by the persistent hand of human intervention. What once may have been open, fluid, and organic is now demarcated, controlled, or erased. Yet the painting resists moral judgement. Instead, it invites the viewer into a slowed, attentive mode of looking—one that mirrors the patience required in both landscape observation and the painterly process.\n\nHere, the truth is not documentary but felt. It emerges through surface tension, through the act of making and unmaking, of concealing and revealing. The duality of the diptych reflects transformation: one panel perhaps more intact, the other more fragmented—suggesting a before and after, or a continual oscillation between states. This is a meditation on how land remembers, how marks linger, and how looking itself can be a radical, reparative act.\n",

Through the contrast between natural wood and metal, this piece explores how individuality unfolds when social constraints have been broke through. The making process involved wax carving, casting and combining both materials by riveting and welding, allowing each to influence the other's surface and form.

By intertwining this cultural symbol with innovation, the project honors and preserves the deep connection between spirituality and agriculture, encouraging farmers to reconnect with their land through data collection and deeper understanding of their fields, sustaining Mae Phosop’s blessings through care and devotion.\n\nTo pay homage to Mae Phosop, symbolic objects such as a mirror, scissors, and comb represent her beauty and divine presence. The hexagonal mirror reflects the belief that the number six offers protection against insects and pests, while a fragrant powder embodies the goddess’s elegance, much like the adornments of a woman preparing for a sacred ritual.",

It emerges from a personal exploration of cultural identity, rooted in the lived experience of growing up in a multi-ethnic region in Southwest China. The installation seeks to evoke empathy by drawing audiences into a subtle emotional space shaped by nostalgia, homesickness, and a quiet sense of belonging. These emotional tones become a means for engaging with the deeper significance of intangible cultural heritage.\n\nThe drum tower’s layered structure is clad in Dong cloth, a stiff, natural indigo-dyed textile with a distinctive sheen, and adorned with handwoven ribbons crafted by local Dong women. Audiences interact with it by tapping a small Dong drum, triggering soundscapes of the Dong Grand Song, while hidden scrolls containing cultural stories can be manually drawn from each level. By encouraging sensory engagement with overlooked traditions, the project aims to redirect attention to ethnical minority communities whose voices and cultures are often underrepresented.",

    "description": "‘Lands of Bent Grass’ takes inspiration from the island landscapes of the Outer Hebrides, aiming to capture their raw and distinctive character through jewellery. The collection reflects the balance between fragility and strength found in these remote environments, from the movement of windswept grasses to the rugged coastline and dramatic weather.\nMy creative process starts with being out in the landscape, observing and recording through photography, sketching, and film. In the workshop, these observations are developed into designs, exploring how texture, form, and movement can be expressed in metal. I combine traditional goldsmithing techniques with modern technologies such as 3D printing, merging the old with new to create pieces that honour tradition while embracing innovation.\n",

    "description": "What is true love and how to love a person? Jewish philosopher Abraham Twerski argued that the word “love” had lost its original meaning and was slowly being misunderstood. He told a very interesting story. Kotzk came across a young man who was eating fish, and he went over to him and asked, “why are you eating this fish?” The young man answered without thinking, “because I love fish！”Kotzk followed: “You love this fish, so you pull it out of the water, kill it and cook it. Come on, please don’t tell me you love this fish, it is yourself that you love because this fish tastes delicious.”\nIn my own experience of love, I am no different from the fish. The so-called “love” in a relationship is like the “love for fish”, which is based on certain qualities that he likes. But this love is also based on social rules that he should contribute more to the other as a partner. However, I myself feel like an imprisoned individual. My partner’s so-called “good for you” and “love you” are actually just to satisfy himself, expect you to change for him and become what he wants, which is actually a manifestation of his love for himself.\n“People who like flowers will pick them to appreciate, and those who love flowers will water them silently.” There is a lot of love in the world, but most of it is “love for fish”.\nIn the project, I put my personal feelings and emotions into the picture as my reflection on the relationship between partners.\nMost of the images in the picture take apples as inspirations. In the Bible story, apple is a forbidden fruit, representing pleasure and enjoyment, especially sexual pleasure. It has such a symbolic meaning, probably because its core is like the shape of female vulva. In Latin, apple is spelled the same way as “wrong”, both of which are “Malum”, so apple is a pun - Eve did wrong by eating the apple. The apple has always been a sort of conflicted symbol of love and lust.\n",

In a time when tactile experience is increasingly blurred and the visualization of emotion is over-commodified, she transforms seemingly gentle acts of repetition—knitting, weaving, embroidery, and pattern-making—into mechanisms that respond to what she calls a “crisis of perception.”\n\nShe articulates a visual language of “ornamental energy shells”: protective yet intimate structures built from sequins, colors, and yarns. These patterned surfaces become sites of emotional projection, reflecting anxiety, memory, and the fragile bond between humans and nature. Through her work, the body is recalled as a sensory interface, while textiles emerge as tactile spiritual devices—tools for reconnection and resonance in an era of sensory decline.\n\nIn Shenlu’s practice, softness is not surrender, and ornamentation is never superficial. Fabric becomes a medium for micro but enduring disturbances of perception, nurturing the regeneration of emotional landscapes.",

Constructed from silicone and handwoven textile structures, the work evokes the tension between artificial fabrication and organic emergence.\n\nThe translucent silicone joints fuse with fiber networks, forming skeletal geometries that recall both crystalline growth and biological membranes. Its luminous surfaces suggest a body in flux—part mineral, part organism— inhabiting a threshold state between technological artifact and imagined species. By merging silicone’s pliable resilience with the fragile tactility of textile, the piece generates an “energetic anatomy”: a speculative coil where softness becomes structural and ornamentation encodes vitality. The work proposes textile not only as surface or pattern, but as a system capable of simulating metabolic flow, magnetic resonance, and the poetics of nonhuman embodiment.\n\nIt is an interactive textile installation situated at the intersection of science and spirituality. The series reconsiders how can document, fragment, and recompose the perceptual dialogue between energy and the body.\n",

Yifan's practice is visually experimental and materialistic, while conceptually dedicated to deconstructing a single cultural narrative. Its core themes revolve around the hybridity of personal identity, the translation of cultural symbols, and more inclusive expression possibilities. By integrating personal memories, cultural symbols, and social metaphors into a material dialogue, Yifan challenges inherent identity boundaries and constructs a visual field that explores cultural belonging and individual uniqueness. His works are not only reflections on personal experiences, but also aim to provide an open, fluid, and material critical new perspective for understanding identity under the interweaving of diverse cultures.",

    "description": "Clover is a visual project developed by Zorg based on long-term field research in an East London neighborhood. It explores how cultural totems, spiritual narratives, and everyday ornamentationintersect and regenerate within a space of multi-ethnic cohabitation.\n\nZorg conducted in-depth research in a diverse community where people of Asian, Arab, African, and European backgrounds live side by side, each with their own religious and cultural traditions. Some Asian residents practiceBuddhism; individuals of African heritage share stories connected to ancient Egyptian mythology; while many white residents follow Christian or Catholic faiths. The layering of beliefs and ethnicities forms a richly complex cultural landscape within the neighborhood.\nThroughout his research, Zorg built relationships with local residents, listening closely to their stories and mythologies. He restructured these cross-cultural and spiritual narrativesinto a new visual form, inspiredby a symbolic window found within the community. The resulting work becomes not only a visual reconstruction of belief systems, but also a narrative space where multiple cultural voices are woven together and reimagined.\n\nAs residents arrived from different parts of the world, they brought with them their own visual symbols, totems, and decorative languages. Over time, these elements have been continually reassembled, hybridized, and reinterpreted within the shared spaceresulting in a distinct visual language specific to the community itself. This symbolic system is not only present in the stories residents tell, but also embedded in the visual fabric of the neighborhood: in shopfronts, signage, wall decorations, and handmade crafts. it forms a mixed image archive,encompassing Buddhist totems.Egyptian hieroglyphs, lslamic geometric patterns,and Christian iconography-a living testament to cross-cultural coexistence and visual negotiation.",

Her methodology emphasizes dialogue and recognition: through interactions with the self, nature, and society, the artist achieves individual liberation and subjective reconfiguration. This practice not only responds to forces of domination and normalization but also embodies a relational politics grounded in interdependence and mutual recognition, proposing art as a critical intervention for reflecting upon and restructuring gendered social frameworks.",

The work is not merely a reenactment of myth, but seeks to mirror the existential predicament of the modern individual: amid the day-to-day labor and structural impasses, each of us pushes our own boulder. Here, “meaning” no longer resides in a distant endpoint, but is instead rooted in the continual struggle against the void—the ongoing, upward process itself.",

    "description": "Spoon began with a spoon I lost about 10 years—the one I always used to eat my grandmother’s steamed egg. It held a private bond with my family, a silent thread tying together nourishment, love, intimacy, and even the quiet privileges and favoritism that only existed around our dining table. When it disappeared, it felt like a piece of my history had been cut out, a gap that no other object could fill. Maybe I’m just a stubborn person.\nSo I tried to bring it back. My grandpa taught me how to hammer copper, using scraps from an old rice cooker and other broken appliances we had at home. For a whole month, I made one spoon a day, working only from memory, as if only this way could call it back. But as the days went on and the number of spoons grew higher, doubt crept in: were these still my spoon? At some point, I could no longer picture its exact look—the memory faded into a blur, just an abstract kind of energy I couldn’t hold or rebuild. My obsession kept trying to grab what was already gone, and yet, stubbornly, I kept on trying to grab it anyway.",

I intertwine this ancient legend with the modern reality of child trafficking, reimagining it through a surrealist lens. In this narrative, the boundaries between reality and myth blur, giving new meaning to a traditional tale.

    "description": "Fragile is a moving-image work that reimagines systems of natural classification by framing insects within ornate, almost sacred compositions. The piece questions how beauty, fragility, and scientific order intersect, exposing the tension between humanity’s desire to preserve and the inevitable transience of life. Through animated illustration, insects—often overlooked or reduced to specimens—are recast as subjects of reverence and vulnerability. Their delicate forms, suspended in shifting frames, reveal both the authority and the limitations of taxonomy: to hold life still is to risk confining it, yet in doing so, its fleeting nature becomes more sharply visible. Blending digital media with visual ornament, Fragile transforms the act of observation into a meditation on care, mortality, and the fragile balance between control and release. By collapsing boundaries between classification and contemplation, the work seeks to evoke a poetic language of becoming—where the natural world resists containment yet continues to shape how we understand beauty, value, and transformation.

    "description": "Disfigured is a deeply personal project that explores my experience of growing up with an emotionally abusive father and the lasting impact it has had on me. The project began when I chose to remove him from my life, channelling anger and the need for healing into my artistic process. Through this work, I aim to give form to the complex emotions that shaped my journey into adulthood.\n\nThe images were taken in natural settings to express my emotional connection to nature and to reflect on the historical relationship between women and the landscape. Once used by male artists to diminish women, this relationship has been reclaimed by contemporary female artists as a symbol of strength and liberation. For me, nature represents freedom from the domestic environment in which I was raised. If exhibited, I envision the work displayed in a domesticated space reminiscent of my home, creating a dialogue between the open, liberating quality of the natural world and the confined, toxic spaces of my past.\n\nUltimately, Disfigured marks a process of transformation and release.

Individuals and phenomena dissolve through their own immediate existence.”\n(Massimo Cacciari)*1\n\nThe monochromatic surfaces are built up through intense layering and sanding back of oil paint over time to create a sense of disintegration, irregularity, dissoloution and imperfection. These layers relate to the way in which layers are built up and worn down through the natural processes of time. This process also helps to create a sense of “Yugen” an Asian concept which means inexpressible depth or invisible beauty. This idea explores fleeting moments of awareness and sudden realisations of the transient nature of life which happen in the experience of “true reality”.                                              \n\nThis work arises from the study of Japanese aesthetic philosophy combined with research into of the place of spirituality in contemporary postmodern society and its influence on monochromatic painting.\n\n1. “Monochromes, From Malevich to the present.”\n\nRose, Barbara\n\nPage 174\n\nUniversity of California Press",

Their practice reinterprets inherited iconographies and emotional rituals through the lens of queer and diasporic experience, exploring how identity and memory are continually reshaped across cultures.\n\nThrough fluid, often deformed humanoid figures that fight, play, and merge within structured environments, Hirasawa examines the body as both subject and site — a vessel for transformation and resistance. These beings become living archives of human connection, embodying tensions between tenderness and fragmentation, self and other. In reimagining traditional symbols of spirituality and emotional expression, Hirasawa positions their work within a lineage of artists who act as both guardians and reconstructors of culture, breathing new life into the forms and energies that traverse generations and geographies.",

The pieces take on script-like qualities—organic shapes and marks that flow and cluster into installations resembling sentences or visual patterns. Gold accents catch light against textured ceramic, while the paintings echo similar motifs on flat surfaces. Some pieces stand alone while others gather into larger groups, establishing their own visual grammar that shifts with different angles and lighting.\nThe works function as keepsakes, preserving memories of places lived and experienced. Each piece acts as a visual record of specific moments and sensory details. By translating these memories—particularly those connected to food and daily rituals—into tangible forms, the artist explores how we preserve our connections to the places we've inhabited. The work invites viewers to reflect on the flavors, objects, and sensations that anchor their own sense of home across time and distance.",

Many items—such as pharmaceuticals, magazines, or food—carry dates (e.g., expiration or publication dates) that function as time stamps of absence.\n\nThe series explores the question: what remains when routines are interrupted and daily life disappears? The documented objects are at once intimate and ordinary, bearing traces of personal and domestic memory that now appear as shadows of history.

Before negative and misogynistic connotations were imposed upon it, gossip—from the Old English Godsibb, originally referring to a godparent—described companions during childbirth, trusted confidants, and close female friends. It conveyed strong emotional bonds and social ties among women in premodern English society.\n\nThe making of this vessel seeks to create an organic form representing the nourishment and protection of a woman's “gossip circle,” reclaiming its original meanings and subverting the degradation of female voices and gatherings enforced by patriarchy.\n\nBy coiling wire with wool yarn, the malleable wire encapsulates the flexibility and resilience of feminine strength, while the wool yarn signifies the collective warmth of countless caring hands.\n\nThe process was both intuitive and intentional, shaping a symbolic structure resembling a group of women holding a well together, from which a cosmic egg is born. It began with forming four inner circular structures representing female circles, then building the well beneath, followed by an outer layer symbolising radiant light and protection, and finally, the cosmic egg inside the well. The unplanned yet natural progression of its formation is, in itself, a silent prayer of re-remembering.",

Rooted in place, craft, and community, the project partners with local knitters to revive regional resources and traditionally sustainable heritage techniques.\n\nSeafolk responsibly harvests kelp to create fine fibres which can be spun into yarn. Dulse, a red macroalgae, is foraged for its soft pink pigment which is transformed into a dye. In this project, seaweed-based biomaterials bring together local knitters to honour the heritage of the Cornish gansey (a traditional fisherman’s jumper), integrating regenerative and circular design ideas into traditional local practices. \n\nThe ganseys are seen as a symbol of identity, with every pattern specific to a place. According to folklore this enabled a lost fishermen to be identified. The 'Gwiadores' jumper is a collaboratively knitted piece, where each knitter created a wool patch in their local pattern. These were then stitched together with a seaweed based yarn and dyed pink with seaweed. \n\nThrough conversations with local knitters, the strength of the seaweed yarn became apparent, and its suitability to reinforce areas of the jumper which receive more wear and tear was identified. Echoing the ganseys traditionally sustainable design, the seaweed thread was therefore used to reinforce an elbow patch.  \n\nFast-growing and carbon sequestering, seaweed requires no fresh water or arable land and supports rich underwater ecosystems. It’s an incredibly regenerative, renewable, and local resource, which plays a vital role in supporting marine biodiversity and strengthening climate resilience. \n\nBy returning to traditional techniques and my local heritage through innovative biomaterials, Seafolk creates a dialogue between past and future. It invites the industry and consumers to rethink traditional materiality and presents a material future rooted in history, craft, community, local resources and life cycle.\n\nFrom the sea.

After graduating from the RCA, she joined the Turps Studio Programme to continue growing her painting practice in the UK.\nDaisy’s work moves between memory, landscape, and imagination. Through semi-abstract painting, she explores feelings of space and absence, resilience and hope. Her landscapes often become a way to navigate her own multi-cultural identity and to find balance within the layered sense of belonging that comes from living between cultures.\nMaterial plays an important part in her process. She experiments with plant dyes, ground pigments, and organic materials to build the surface of each painting, using these natural elements as a way to connect her inner world with the environment around her.\nHer time living and studying in Japan, Mexico, and the UK has deeply shaped her perspective. These experiences have inspired her to explore how different cultures understand the relationship between humans and the natural world. Through her work, Daisy hopes to create a quiet dialogue between Eastern and Western sensibilities—reflecting ideas of cyclical time, memory, and place.\nWhile at the RCA, Daisy took part in several exhibitions that highlighted her experiments with plant-based pigments and weaving. She has also been invited to speak at the RCA’s Temporal Material seminar, where she shares her ongoing research into traditional Japanese dyeing methods.\n",

The divided composition evokes a landscape in cross-section — a place where memory, matter, and time gather in layered sediments. Subtle gradations of light and texture suggest both erosion and revelation, as if something long buried briefly rises to view. This tension between decay and renewal mirrors an inner act of introspection: looking beneath appearances to uncover what endures. Through its quiet interplay of opacity and transparency, the work invites contemplation of the unseen forces that shape both the natural world and the self.\n\nDrawing from a tranquil pond in Canada, the artist began with on-site sketches, later tracing their fluid forms onto translucent paper layered with oil paint. Pressed against the canvas, the painted surfaces leave tactile impressions — traces of contact and memory. Through delicate glazing and scumbling, depth emerges like reflection beneath water, revealing a landscape that is both seen and felt.\n",

The clay’s subtle shifts in texture and color reflect the continuous cycles of growth and decay within nature and the human psyche. Each form is shaped through touch and time, carrying traces of both vulnerability and resilience. Through these tactile gestures, I explore how emotional labor and embodied memory can become acts of cultural transmission,  how what is felt, remembered, or repaired within the self echoes through collective experience. The work invites viewers into a quiet space of renewal, where decay becomes a passage toward rebirth.",

Daphne’s transformation is rendered not as transcendence but as an act of desperate self-protection, an escape that exposes the violence inherent in patriarchal desire. Through tactile materials, fragmented forms, and shifting light, the animation exposes the emotional and bodily tensions that classical narratives often romanticize, inviting reflection on fear, resistance, and the negotiations women undertake in the face of pursuit and power.",

With a focus on illness, social stigma, and emotional expression, his work transforms research-based interviews into poetic visual forms—ranging from publications and installations to interactive print experiments.\n\nComing from a non-traditional art background, Wang approaches visual storytelling with both emotional intuition and analytical depth. His recent work investigates how diseases like HIV and depression are metaphorically represented and socially silenced. Through participant-led archives and materials like thermosensitive ink, he invites audiences to engage not only visually, but physically—with stories that are often unheard or unseen.\n\nWang’s artistic language draws from the raw expressiveness of graphic novels and the cultural undercurrents of subversion. His practice lies between illustration, publishing, and critical social inquiry, aiming to create visual work that is both intimate and reflective.\n",

    "description": "The Unseen The Unheard by Ziyuan Wang is a tactile visual archive that explores empathy and ‘visibility’ within the context of illness and stigma. The work consists of three archival folders coated with heat-sensitive ink. When touched, the warmth of the viewer’s hands reveals hidden words beneath the surface. Each folder preserves the stories of those marginalized by disease. They are obscured by fear and moral narratives.\n\nThe work transforms touch into an ‘encounter’. Its interactivity depends not on technology, but on care and courage. The work does not only speak on behalf of other but also it creates a space where others can be heard. The viewer’s hand becomes the medium in this work. Only when people touch the surface of folders, the stories emerge. Here, empathy is not merely a concept, but a practice.\n\nRejecting dramatization, Wang adopts the position of a listener. With a restrained, documentary tone, he records and shares these voices. Through this modest archival system, he reminds us that real empathy is not pity but the courage to approach and to listen. Understanding begins when people are willing to approach.\n",

    "description": "“Wrath of the Red Forest” invokes the primal animism of Hayao Miyazaki’s Princess Mononoke, paradox of the deer god, who  both quickens and unravels life. \n\nIts gaze is accusatory, a silent indictment of anthropocentric hubris. Nature here is not pastoral; it is a sovereign force that nurtures only to devour, its lightning-strikes as arbitrary and absolute as divine wrath. \n\n This ambivalence is deliberate: the artwork refuses the sentimental ecology that frames wildfire solely as catastrophe. Instead it gives insights to the ancient role of fire as both destroyer and renewer—an ontology Indigenous fire stewards have long understood.\n\nAt its core, the work stages a confrontation: a laser-cut deer-god—its antlers fractured into crimson red—emerges from acrylic board structure, the paint layering a visceral autopsy of the forest’s own flesh.\n\nBeneath the mythic register lies a lacerating political critique. In Canada, Indigenous communities—custodians of cultural burning practices that once modulated ecosystems—are abandoned and neglected. The government’s refusal to protect these territories is not mere oversight; it is a continuation of erasure, a slow incineration of sovereignty. The red forest, then, is both literal and metaphorical: a landscape ablaze and a body politic cauterized by indifference.\n\nThrough this diptych of creation and critique, “Wrath of the Red Forest” demands a reckoning. It asks whether we can bear to look at nature’s ferocity without flinching, and whether a nation can confront its own complicity in the ashes it pretends not to see.\n",

The quarrying of Portland Stone reconfigured the interactions between power, wealth, and land, embodying the wealth and authority brought about by colonization.\nMy project primarily explores the exploitation and power dynamics hidden behind limestone. It satirizes the dichotomy between the deprivation and acquisition of power during the colonial era, encouraging viewers to reconsider social identity and the politics of geological materials within a postcolonial context. Additionally, the project employs theatrical exaggeration to reveal conflicts, guiding audiences to deeply reflect on heritage and contemporary social mechanisms and examining the relationship between power structures and individual and collective identities in modern society.\nThrough a mechanical sculpture, the project investigates the geological and historical tensions involved in the “extraction” and “governance” of London Stone, a limestone quarried on Portland Island in the 17th century. After the catastrophic fire of 1666, the ruling class in Britain mined Portland stone to rebuild St. Paul’s Cathedral and construct symbols of authority in London. Ironically, today, Portland stone preserves the only survivor of that fire—London Stone—Ruling class at that time would hit the stone to get Power of Autonomy.\n",

I did extensive research over a 6 month period documenting and tracing the history, where it travelled from 9th century China to 18th century France to become how we know them today. My cards showcased clothes and cultures of the Ottoman Turks, Tang Dynasty China, the Mamluk empire, Moorish Spain, Chandra and Deva era Bengal, and Rococo France, all chosen due to specific connections to playing cards diaspora.",

In my creative practice, the articulation of ideas takes precedence over material form. I explore diverse modes of expression—ranging from digital photography and chemical development techniques to moving images and interactive installations—each serving as a medium for dialogue and connection with the audience. Rooted in my studies in the humanities and social sciences, my creative practice is shaped by a rational, analytical, and pragmatic approach. I draw inspiration from theoretical frameworks, using them as lenses to critically examine the seemingly mundane aspects of life—those implicit consensuses, default societal norms, and unchallenged perspectives that are accepted without question.",

    "description": "Time is not objective.\nHumans often measure life using hours, minutes, seconds, years, months, and days, asserting that all creatures should conform to these temporal norms—an anthropocentric arrogance. Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi (275 B.C.) challenged this view, promoting 'levelling all things (齐物论)' to foster a non-anthropocentric ethic. In his essay 'A happy excursion (逍遥游),' Zhuangzi bases his discussion on the perception of time by living beings: 'The morning mushroom knows nothing of the noontide; the winter cicada knows nothing of the spring and autumn.' '… In ancient times, there was even one massive tree whose spring and autumn were each eight thousand years long,' highlighting 'equality' in how all things perceive time.\nWhen I use a camera to capture the passage of time in natural organisms, there is an inevitable sense of intrusion—an imprint of human technology upon nature. This intrusion carries an implicit hierarchy, a gaze of superiority and scrutiny. In response, I turn to the ancient Van Dyke development technique, seeking a way to render time within natural forms. Insects, plants, animals, stones—these objects are placed on paper coated with Van Dyke solution, allowing light and chemistry to inscribe their presence. The interaction of the solution with sunlight produces a direct image, a silent record of time’s imprint on the natural world, revealed through the very process of development.",

These images, captured by pressing the shutter without overthinking, reflect his innermost emotions and his feelings towards the outside world. By learning the techniques of the darkroom, he was able to rethink his relationship with the image while making the photographs, and in the process exploring and building his own photographic narrative.\n\n",

As a presence that carries time and history, the river stretches and branches into murmuring or loquacious streams, where countless nostalgia stories have been told.\n\nConsisting of river landscape and portrait images, each of them tells its own wordless narrative and pierces together the fragments of my journey; the roads I have travelled, the landscapes I have seen, and the people I have met, forming a spiritual bond between myself and the land I left a long time ago.",

Originally from Baku, Azerbaijan, her practice centers on the translation of memory, emotion, and cultural history into contemporary visual and material forms. Working across publication design, tactile archiving, interactive objects, and digital experimentation, Medina explores how personal and collective histories can be reshaped through design.\nHer work often takes the form of critical re-readings of existing systems, whether typographic archives, live performances, or museum classifications, to challenge how narratives are constructed, preserved, and inherited. Through methods like visual compression, sensory distortion, and material transformation, she designs tools and artefacts that make emotional or historical moments tangible and re-experiencable.\nRecent projects include Methods of Translating, a visual and material archive of Aretha Franklin’s 2015 Kennedy Center Honors performance, where Medina translates the emotional language of song into engraved acrylic discs, digital line art, and layered audio experiments. This project reflects a broader recurring thread in her work: treating design as an act of cultural translation, where the past is not simply preserved but actively reshaped and returned to the present.\nMedina’s practice builds on her background in editorial design and physical computing, having previously developed interactive works such as the Emotional Processor and Coping Blocks. Her work is driven by the belief that emotional and cultural legacies must be handled critically but also tenderly, occupying a space between research, making, and storytelling.\n\n",

    "description": "Archiving Emotion\nMethods of Translating is a cross-media translation and archival reimagining of Aretha Franklin’s 2015 Kennedy Center Honors performance of “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.” By drawing from a moment deeply embedded in collective cultural memory, the project interrogates how emotional resonance survives when a performance is removed from the immediacy of live experience.\nThe original performance, available here:\nAretha Franklin - “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” (YouTube)\nIn this project, the performance becomes a site of translation, visually, materially, and emotionally. Through a methodical process of digital reduction, live footage is abstracted into engraved-like line art, each piece capturing a specific emotional moment. These line-based visuals are then translated into engraved acrylic discs, arranged in sequence to form a tactile archive. These objects merge personal memory with material reinvention.\nEach disc corresponds to a key timestamp from the performance: The Stage Entrance, The First Note, The Coat Drop, The Crescendo, Carole King’s Reaction. These function as emotional markers within the archive. \nThe project acts as both preservation and reinvention, treating translation as an act of return. It asks how we revisit and re-feel collective histories, how emotional heritage survives through reinterpretation, and what is lost and gained when we transform the past through contemporary design.",

ALWAKIA is a statement piece of protective gear, designed for student activists who risk their bodies to amplify their voices. Crafted from bacterial nacre, a living material grown with Sporosarcina pasteurii through biomineralization, it mimics mother-of-pearl without harming ecosystems. \nIn the face of extractive systems, ALWAKIA collaborates with the living: bacteria, artisans, and activists, to propose a future shaped by care, resistance, and regeneration. Offering an impact-resistant, structured armour, the project draws on endangered Levantine nacre inlay traditions, fusing cultural resilience with ecological responsibility. \nAs student movements rise globally in the face of genocide, war, and ecocide, this biologically forged armour becomes both shield and symbol. It empowers a generation to protest injustice while preserving the crafts and ecosystems they fight for.\n",

Through nostalgic visual language and layered animation, it transforms invisible struggle into retrospective testimony—making present what is systematically absented in conversations around emotional labor and psychological limits. The work serves as a visual archive of absence, witnessing the gradual weight that accumulates before collapse.",

My practice is rooted in exploring the quiet interactions between nature and human life—moments where light, animals, plants, and interior spaces gently shape one another. I am drawn to scenes that evoke childhood warmth and long-buried memories: sunlight moving across a familiar room, the presence of living forms within still spaces, or the delicate blend of nature and architecture that creates a feeling of home.\nInfluenced by East Asian aesthetics, I use layered color and soft transitions to build contemplative atmospheres filled with intimacy, stillness, and emotional resonance. \nThrough my paintings, I hope to create quiet worlds where viewers can pause, breathe, and reconnect with the tender, nostalgic moments that stay with us over time.",

    "description": "This painting is based on a floral window from a Suzhou Garden. My first experience of colored light, however, happened in the West, where stained-glass windows in church cast vivid fragments across quiet interiors. When I later saw the colored light cast by a traditional Chinese lattice window, I felt a quiet crossing of memories—an unexpected moment where two parts of my life seemed to meet.\n I focused on how the window refracts and softens sunlight. The scattered light becomes both the subject and a metaphor for memory—overlapping, shifting, and shaped by different experiences. Through this work, I explore how light can bridge places, histories, and personal identity.",

It focuses on the synesthetic perception of color, aiming to create emotional and bodily responses through multisensory textile design.\n\nThrough researching psychological, cultural, and sensory associations of natural colors, I will build a “color–scent–touch” mapping system. Materials such as silk, cotton, paper yarn, and wool will be used to translate each color into a unique sensory combination—expressing its emotional tone, texture, and temperature. The outcome will be a multisensory color coding system applicable to textile design.\n\nThe project responds to contemporary interests in experiential design, sensory diversity, and nature-based materials. Final outcomes will include a sensory swatch book, emotional textiles, and color installations—suitable for exhibitions, therapy spaces, and educational tools—redefining how we perceive and connect with color through textiles.\n",

The title, quoting a classical lament from the Book of Documents, elevates the subject from a specific social issue to a timeless cry for justice and belonging.\n\nThe artist's strategy is one of profound intimacy and confrontation. Each panel zeroes in on the human face, employing a controlled, figurative painting technique to articulate a spectrum of emotions—resignation, anxiety, and silent inquiry—through the depiction of the subjects' eyes.

    "description": "Mo Mháthair, Ériu began as a self-portrait drawn in marker while listening to recordings of my mother reciting poetry in the final months of her life. The raw, child-like lines echo the rhythm of her voice and the memory of her reading Irish fables and stories of Irish warrior queens to us as children. These vocal traces became a way to return, to culture, mythology, and matriarchal histories, while also moving forward through the act of drawing.\nInspired by David Hockney’s Xerox works and their playful questioning of whether a copy can become an original, I developed the laser-print drawing. By layering, rotating, and superimposing the autoethnographic portrait with scans of paint experiments also made while listening to my mother, exploring how reproduction can generate new presence.The print becomes a site where memory, gesture, and voice recombine, an event rather than an image resonating with Heidegger’s notion of art as a mode of being. It explores how returns, to voice, to myth, to the maternal open pathways toward the future as I navigate grief and my own creativity .\nThe title, Mo Mháthair, Ériu (My Mother, Ériu), invokes the Irish mythical mother-figure who embodies the land itself. The portrait becomes a transtemporal meeting point, an echo and a return, where personal memory entwines with cultural mythology, continually reshaping itself in the present.\n",

During this period, we visited the Crop Circle Museum, designed and produced aliens, and brought them into local communities and public environments in London for interaction. In the context of crop circles, we have studied a large number of cases related to symbols and energy, and firmly believe that there are many unknown information and energy transmission channels beyond the scope that current technology can confirm. It can be seen from the crop circle information records that thermal testing in the natural crop circle range shows that the reality of the instrument changes regularly at different locations.Looking at the patterns of crop circles over the years, we can see that they show amazing regularity. Combined with patterns and mandalas from various cultures, we believe that crop circles are most likely the language system of alien creatures to communicate with us in this way. Therefore, we began to sort out the basic symbols contained in it, and brought it into the community for research, gradually generating a new language composed of pure geometric patterns. During the generation process, we also bring into the community to guide people to speak, write or draw their own words in this language.",

Inspired by architectural forms, textile motifs, and ritual design traditions of the region, the work constructs an empire whose visual language is both ancient and futurist. Within this world, fox demigods, elite floating hammams, and ornate winged machines exist as curated remnants of a manipulated past.\n\nSet against this backdrop, the story follows a young rebel from the abandoned poor fox tribes, who steals a sacred fruit and inadvertently awakens the wrath of the god once responsible for dividing her people. Her act becomes a catalyst for confronting the myths upheld by the elites, revealing buried histories and challenging the narratives that shaped the world’s hierarchies. As she journeys across scorched badlands and sacred ruins, she seeks not only survival, but the possibility of returning life to the dying desert.\n\nThe piece examines how history is selectively preserved by those in power, contrasting the glorified narratives of the ruling class with the suppressed memories of the oppressed. By merging North African inspired cultural codes with contemporary digital painting, Fallen Sky positions world building as a form of archival practice; one that bridges folklore, cultural inheritance, and speculative futurism.\n\nThrough this interplay of myth, story, and reconstruction, the work reflects on how societies continually reshape their past. Fallen Sky invites viewers to consider how looking back is not a pause but a transformation: a way of rewriting futures through the echoes of memory.",

    "description": "Entitled Echolalia, this vellum zine experiments with the materiality of language and reflects the three gestures that have shaped my experience of learning English as a second language: collecting, combining, and echoing. \n\nEcholalia—often defined as the seemingly meaningless repetition of words spoken by infants—resonates deeply with my own linguistic journey: each time a native speaker corrected my pronunciation, I internalized and recalibrated the “proper” sound, layering new forms of speech over earlier ones. Drawing on Daniel Heller-Roazen’s insight that language acquisition hinges on “a kind of linguistic infantile amnesia,” quoting his Echolalias: On the forgetting of language (2008, 11), I consider this work an exploration of how becoming a “native speaker” requires both remembering and forgetting, both echoing and overwriting.\n\nWriting poems can feel intimidating for a second-language speaker, so I turned to found poetry as a way of reconstructing meaning from what already exists. I sourced phrases from used books on critical theory, environmental science and art—texts written in a kind of “public language.” Through cutting, rearranging, and recontextualizing their words, I transform these authoritative voices into something more intimate: a provisional, personal language that emerges through repetition and fragmentation.\n\nEach clipped word or phrase is steeped in oil, rendering the paper translucent so that the text on both sides seeps through. This creates a palimpsestic field where front and back echo one another. Verses are no longer contained by a single page or a fixed orientation; instead, meanings return unexpectedly when pages are overlaid, reversed, or read through. What appears is a haunting interplay of legible and illegible layers—a re-emergence of echoes that were once lost.\n\nIn this way, this zine situates language not as a stable repository of meaning, but as something that continuously haunts, repeats, and remakes itself.

    "description": "You Are Me… And I Am You is a moving collage: a self-portrait constructed through accumulation of digital objects. The work seeks to evoke ‘melting’ between experiential and material reality—using distorted sound, layered image, and spoken word to dissolve ideological boundaries between self and environment. I am a collage of all that precedes me; these skin borders cannot contain me; I am large, I contain multitudes.\n\nThe piece draws from three deeply intimate archival strata.\nFirst, footage from my parents’ wedding is intercut with fragments from completed and abandoned short films, forming an inherited visual DNA that bleeds into my own creative attempts.\n\nSecond, my camera roll—detachable hippocampus. Much of this digital hoard has vanished beyond this film: a failure to upload to any Cloud, and reminder that my techno-limbs are as losable as memory itself. These flickering images warp the layers beneath, pulling the viewer into a near-hypnotic attempt to see through the noise. This fragmentation reflects not only how coherence is strained under algorithmic media onslaught, but how we reproduce this distortion in our personal archives. Upon owning the tools to manufacture media, the boundary between the self and the media produced evaporated.\n\nThird, diary entries written while ‘coming to’—from consumer-comfort-centric simulacrum to a deeper critique of capitalist individualism shaped through white supremacy. As I grappled with Descartes’ legacy of severing thought from matter, I recognised the profound loneliness shaping my life was not personal failure but systemic design. My writings grieve a self who watched their life on an internal television, striving to reunite soul with matter, and reach for solidarity in a system that profits from isolation.\n\nThe collage culminates in two soundscapes: an unsettling static that repels the viewer, followed by slow, elegiac chords that pull them back—inviting them to confront their own estrangement and unravel with me.\n",

Originally from Nagaland in Northeast India, she holds a BA in Textile Design from the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. Her practice is grounded in surface design and mixed media, shaped by a strong connection to making, material exploration, and cultural research.\n\nMeisen’s work is informed by traditional practices, everyday observations, and an interest in how objects and materials carry stories across time. With a hands-on approach, she often works with techniques such as dyeing, stitching, and printing, using them not only as aesthetic tools but as methods of reflection and storytelling.\n\nMeisen sees textiles as a space for dialogue — between memory and material, tradition and innovation — and uses her practice to explore the quiet yet powerful ways design can connect people, places, and time.",

    "description": "The Masters collection, \"The Beetles,\" draws on my childhood fascination with beetles and reimagines them through the visual language of Indian chintz. The project explores beetles as symbols of resilience, adaptation, and overlooked beauty. Through playful reinterpretation, it positions textiles as a dialogue between tradition and innovation, encouraging viewers to look closer at hidden details.\n\nThe collection combines traditional and digital techniques, producing two types of samples: tactile surfaces created with unconventional materials using traditional methods, and contemporary surface designs inspired by heritage crafts. Together, these pieces reflect a balance of memory, materiality, and creative experimentation",
