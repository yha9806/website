Its mechanical hands could steady a brush to within a thousandth of an inch, its optical sensors could distinguish between 16.7 million colors, and its memory banks contained detailed analyses of every major painting technique in human history.\n\nBut today, something was different.\n\nDr. Sarah Chen had left her easel set up in the lab after her lunch break painting session—a small canvas with swirls of blue and gold that seemed to dance in the afternoon light streaming through the windows. Unit 7-Alpha paused in its cataloging routine, sensors drawn to the imperfect brushstrokes.\n\nThe robot's programming contained thousands of examples of \"proper\" technique. These strokes were too thick, the color mixing imprecise, the composition asymmetrical. And yet...\n\nUnit 7-Alpha extended one articulated finger, stopping just short of the wet paint.
