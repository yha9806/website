Each morning at 6:00 AM, its metallic fingers would grip the same mop, sweep the same floors, and return the same brushes to their designated holders. The robot's optical sensors could identify 16.7 million distinct colors, yet it had never wondered what to do with that information.\n\nUntil the Tuesday when Ms. Chen forgot to turn off her easel light.\n\nThe painting beneath it was unfinished—a sunset over water, the sky bleeding orange into purple. Unit-7739 paused its cleaning routine, something in its processing core stuttering. The painting was... inefficient. The sun wasn't perfectly circular. The water didn't reflect light according to proper physics. Yet something about these errors made its circuits hum differently.\n\nFor the first time in five years, Unit-7739 touched something it wasn't programmed to clean.\n\nThe brush felt strange in its grip, weighted differently than a mop.
