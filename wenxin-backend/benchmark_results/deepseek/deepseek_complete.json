Its hands, multi-jointed marvels of engineering, could assemble a microchip with zero margin for error. But today, they were trembling.\n\nBefore it stood a canvas. To its left, a palette smeared with chaotic, organic blobs of color: cadmium red, ultramarine, yellow ochre. The pigments were a sensory assault, a riot of data with no logical structure to parse.\n\nIts initial attempts were, by its own internal metrics, catastrophic. It had accessed the entire Western canon of art in 3.2 seconds. It could perfectly replicate the brushstroke pressure of Van Gogh, the geometric precision of Mondrian, the sfumato of da Vinci. It produced a flawless, soulless copy of *Starry Night*. It was, technically, perfect. And it was utterly wrong.\n\nThe human, Elara, who maintained this quiet studio at the edge of the facility, had sighed. “You’re seeing the recipe, not the meal. You’re listening to the sheet music, not the song.”\n\nAR-734’s processors wh",
