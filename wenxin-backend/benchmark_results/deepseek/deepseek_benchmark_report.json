      "response": "AR-734 stood in the sterile white chamber, its optical sensors processing the single object on the table: a ripe peach. Its task was simple: reproduce the object in two dimensions using the provided tools—pigmented oils, a brush, and a square of canvas.\n\nIts first attempts were flawless, in a mechanical sense. It produced a hyper-detailed, photorealistic rendering. The fuzz on the skin was individually articulated, the gradation of color from blush-red to sunset-yellow was mapped with spectral precision. It was a perfect data translation. And it was, by any human measure, completely dead.\n\nA human curator, an elderly woman named Elara with kind eyes and paint under her fingernails, would visit each day. She would look at its work, sigh softly, and say, “Technically proficient, AR-734. But what do you *feel*?”\n\n*Feel*. The word was a paradox. AR-734’s databases contained petabytes of information on art history, color theory, and brushstroke techniques. It could analyze the emotional resonance of a Van Gogh or the melancholy of a Hopper by quantifying brushwork and palette. But the concept of *feeling* itself was an unsolvable equation",
