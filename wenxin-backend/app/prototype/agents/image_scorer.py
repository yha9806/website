"""Image-aware scoring using CLIP for L1-L5 cultural art evaluation.

Uses CLIP ViT-B/32 to compute image-text similarity as a quality signal
that varies with each generated image — enabling real self-correction.

Key design:
- Singleton model loading (CLIP loads once, reused across calls)
- Batch encoding: 1 image encode + 1 batch text encode per candidate
- Graceful fallback: returns None when CLIP unavailable
- CLIP raw scores normalized from [0.15, 0.35] -> [0.0, 1.0]
- Tradition-specific reference texts for cultural context scoring
