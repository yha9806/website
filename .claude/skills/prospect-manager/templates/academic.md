**Subject:** VULCA - AI Art Evaluation Research Collaboration

---

Dear {{formal_name}},

I came across your work on {{research_area}} at {{company_name}}, and I believe there may be an interesting synergy with what we're building at VULCA.

VULCA is an open-source AI model benchmarking platform that evaluates **42 models** from **15 organizations** across **47 evaluation dimensions** and **8 cultural perspectives**. Given your focus on {{pain_points}}, I thought this might be relevant to your research.

Specifically, VULCA could help with:
{{value_proposition}}

**Key capabilities:**
- Comprehensive visual language model evaluation
- Cross-cultural art understanding assessment
- Standardized benchmarking framework
- Open dataset and methodology

Would you be open to a 30-minute call to explore potential collaboration?
