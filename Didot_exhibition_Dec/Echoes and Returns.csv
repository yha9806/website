Presented in 3rd-order Ambisonics (16-channel spatial audio), the work is designed for immersive playback in multichannel speaker arrays, inviting audiences to experience the echoes of a vanishing oral tradition.
Developed during a two-week field trip on La Gomera in June 2025, the project combines location recordings, interviews, and participatory listening sessions with Silbo Gomero speakers and educators. These materials, together with the island’s environmental soundscapes, form the basis of the composition.
Structured around poetic narration, fragmented testimonies, and reconstructed acoustic environments, the piece highlights both the affective and archival dimensions of a language at risk. Silbo Gomero is not only a communicative tool but also a sonic marker of cultural identity and intergenerational memory. By embedding its fragile presence within immersive spatial sound, The Whistled Valley invites listeners to engage with the emotional and historical weight of this unique human expression, standing as a call to listen, remember, and protect intangible heritage before it disappears into silence.

Please note: The Whistled Valley was originally composed in a 16-channels Ambisonic format, intended for playback through a dedicated loudspeaker setup to fully reproduce the spatial experience. For accessibility and review purposes, a binaural rendering of the work is provided via the link.

The core of her creative practice lies in visualizing invisible psychological traumas and societal pressures. She excels at using a hybrid digital media language—combining generative art (TouchDesigner), 3D modeling, and aggressive imagery—to explore the internal struggles faced by contemporary individuals.
Her work often originates from deeply personal experiences. In her project ""Picky Eater,"" a visceral dissection of childhood eating trauma, she transforms abstract emotions—such as suffocation, burnout, and disgust—into perceptible, concrete digital forms by creating sensory experiences that are at once familiar and profoundly unsettling. Her work serves not only as a process of personal memory but also as a sharp response to universal human vulnerabilities and systemic issues, aiming to provoke strong emotional resonance and critical thought from the viewer.
",Picky Eater ,10000,Personal Archives & Family Memories,jiayueyu8@gmail.com,2025,"Personal Memory,Family,Trauma","Video / Moving Image,Digital Art,Generative Art","Digital Video,TouchDesigner,Sound","Picky Eater is an experimental digital video work that delves into the family power dynamics and psychological trauma stemming from childhood memories of picky eating. Rooted in the artist's personal experience, the work translates the suffocating feeling of a love administered 'for one's own good' and the anguish of being force-fed into a visceral and unsettling audio-visual language.
Through organic visuals generated in TouchDesigner that simulate vomit and decaying food, combined with oppressive family recordings and a distorted soundscape, the work constructs a psychological space poised between memory and nightmare. Within the video, the juxtaposition of cold electronic screens against slick, raw meat symbolizes the conflict between a bodily perception alienated by technology and a primal, visceral revulsion.
Ultimately, Picky Eater is not merely a recollection of personal trauma but a profound interrogation of the blurred boundary between 'love' and 'control.' It compels the viewer to reconsider actions, performed in the name of love, that can inflict intangible harm upon an individual.

After completing my BA in Womenswear Design at London College of Fashion in 2024, I continued to explore the intersection of materiality and cultural identity during my Graduate Diploma in Fashion & Textiles at the Royal College of Art in 2025. This journey has now led me back to LCF, where I am pursuing an MA in Fashion Design Management, seeking to expand my understanding of how creative vision can evolve into sustainable systems of value.

My design language emerges from an intuitive conversation between tradition and experimentation. Rooted in my oriental heritage, I often draw from Chinese talismanic symbols, mythic imagery, and natural materials—such as clay, metal, and stone—to create wearable pieces that carry both spiritual and tactile resonance. I see fashion as more than a visual form; it is a vessel of cultural storytelling and emotional energy.

To me, fashion design is like a lotus leaf—anchored in my cultural roots yet freely floating between disciplines, mediums, and meanings. Through this balance of grounding and transcendence, I hope to build a creative practice that bridges the poetic and the practical, the spiritual and the modern.",ALL IS ONE,10001,Cultural Transmission & Regeneration,jiangyf9588@gmail.com,2024,"Fashion,Nature,Mysterious","Garment,Sculpture","Clay,Metal,Jersey Fabric","Rooted in the Taoist and Confucian concept of Tian Ren He Yi (天人合一) — the harmony between humanity and nature — this project examines the delicate balance between the natural and the artificial in contemporary life. Drawing on the Five Elements philosophy of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, the work explores how these forces shape both the physical and spiritual dimensions of existence, continually cycling through creation and decay.

Alongside these classical cosmologies, the project draws inspiration from the animistic traditions of the Bai ethnic group in China, whose nature worship practices emphasise the spiritual vitality of mountains, rivers, and stones. It also incorporates references to Jiama culture — the ritual art of printed talismans used for protection and communication between the human and the divine. By translating these vernacular spiritual symbols into modern design language, the work aims to reenergise their significance in a contemporary, global context.

In today’s technologically accelerated era, where our relationship with nature is increasingly strained, Harmony in Disconnection reimagines how these ancestral philosophies might help us re-evaluate our material and spiritual connection to the natural world. Through the integration of clay, stone, and metal into garment structures and sculptural forms, the work blurs the boundary between the organic and the artificial. Each piece becomes a meditation on coexistence — where material, body, and spirit intertwine, and where ancient ecological wisdom finds new resonance through contemporary fashion practice.",,"https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251008/685fd762eceb0e9b101b120bed97fa65.jpg?width=2481&height=3508,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251008/0301435046eff499e63462b41ef5f3bc.jpg?width=4961&height=3508,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251008/671224ad8f97da89818516529a4a9208.jpg?width=4961&height=3508,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251008/bbaac9e4f6ef92392a9193885f06b27e.jpg?width=4961&height=3508,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251008/498ac7ef2f94d72a9ca257217ad8349e.jpg?width=2080&height=3120",https://youtu.be/G7HAA7_FxSo?si=sQ8_iTAC1nrhnPaW,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251008/f1cda46cdab3f30e30600263df386883.jpg?width=2080&height=3120,jiangyf9588@gmail.com,

Designed for two audiences at a time, this 15-20 minute experience is set in a 
fictional market rooted in Chinese speculative folklore. It introduces Vase Girl and Screen Girl, who act as both narrators and AI-driven performers, inviting participant into a spooky environment layered with interaction: exploring the space, talking with characters, choosing how to respond whether through feeding, touching, and offering, or by learning through ritualised tutorials.These interactions shift the experience from passive observation to co-creation, where audience responses actively shape the unfolding story. 

Over eight months of exploration and experimentation, we developed multiple prototypes across concepts, technologies, and fabrication, engaged with audiences through six public showcases, and continuously refined the work based on feedback from diverse participants. Feedback shows emotions build gradually with all elements connected to form continuity. 

Blessed Market stages the intimacy between AI and humans as uncanny and unstable. The two characters speak to participants, embodying fragments of the story world through installations. This creates the illusion of agency, prompting audiences to relate to AI not as mere tools but as beings with their own identities. 
 
This project explores how the unpredictability, anthropomorphism, and surveillance of artificial intelligence reflect dynamics of intimacy and manipulation.

Myth is not a static archetype, but something continuously reinvented, appropriated, and projected under changing historical conditions. The image and power of the East Asian creation goddess Nüwa, as civilization shifted toward a patriarchal narrative, became embedded within a kinship and marital framework of mutual dependence with Fuxi—thus, through layers of historical storytelling, the goddess transformed from a frog into a serpent-bodied being.

I chose clay—an ancient material that has endured since prehistory—as the primary medium of narration. It reminds us of the fragility and transience of all stories. I regard the act of creation as both reconstruction and speculation: through the accumulation, repetition, and transformation of clay, new relationships and spaces emerge. Filling and hollowing, imitation and inheritance, extension and deviation occur simultaneously.

The work is best displayed on the linked webpage
This work stems, at its core, from two places:
.The concepts explored in my dissertation surrounding how myths, alchemy, and stories can help us create new realities from fiction.

.And secondly, from a beautiful moment I had with a pigeon.

The work is an ongoing exploration of how pigeons are seen in culture, compared to the intimate stories and moments people share with them. It pairs videos of pigeons being herded around parks—disrupting people’s pathways and forcing them to notice the pigeons—with a collection of stories exploring the deep connection between pigeons and those who live on the edges of society, and what this connection may mean for the collective unconscious.

Paradoxically, it is the surrounding water that completes the island. What defines the island lies not within, but outside of it.

Thinking of the flowing waters that trace the island’s edges, I often imagine myself turning into water. In that stillness, the island feels like a delicate life gently held within me, like a fetus resting in the sea of myself.

Perhaps the island is not isolated but deeply entangled with the sea. When the island and the sea reflect, absorb, and dissolve into one another, the island becomes a space where opposites coexist: birth and death, solitude and connection, drifting and anchoring.

From this symbolic interplay, I imagined a fictional island: EvanescentSusurrus. The name combines “Evanescent” (fleeting) and “Susurrus” (a soft whisper). It is a quiet refuge for beings suspended between presence and disappearance.

Over a month, I visited Spanish islands and interviewed people I met by chance. Their voices, dreams, images, sounds, collected materials, and writing fragments gradually converged into one evolving story.

I asked islanders to share memories, secrets, and personal experiences. Some imagined the island as a living being, describing its scent, form, and voice. Others envisioned becoming nonhuman, wondering how they might perceive the world, relate to humans, and what they would long for if they never returned.

This project gathers physical and symbolic fragments from real islands. Like stars forming a constellation, these voices connect to create the imaginary island EvanescentSusurrus.

In the work, shaped by the image of water, visitors encounter these fragments and form their connections. If Narcissus once saw himself in the water, we now meet reflections of others, including nonhuman beings.

Islands are no longer fixed forms. Like drifting lands breathing with the sea, may we each become a quiet, free-floating fragment gently moving through the world.",,"https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251017/42cace9b76d5e056ad7522a900b6b66d.jpg?width=6192&height=7740,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251017/1d8bb0d8e1cca4feedc99ebf6442e4e3.jpg?width=3889&height=4861,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251017/03f62d3ed6d38b65698ef64ffed09ed5.jpg?width=4128&height=5160,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251017/30c82b1ae2642ce9be8b5ce4b7b2fcc6.jpg?width=6192&height=4128,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251017/ec1f5ee01b6b2741af289fbebdc2bf17.jpg?width=2550&height=1421",https://vimeo.com/1102815036?share=copy&fl=sv&fe=ci,,mun121449@gmail.com,

Working at the confluence of critical theory, media studies, and artistic experimentation, his work examines how contemporary technologies intervene in, reshape, and restructure everyday experience. He is particularly concerned with the shifting position of ordinary individuals within social structures under the dominance of grand technological narratives.

Canhe’s trajectory has recently moved from the position of a critical observer to that of an active constructor. He advances the speculative framework of temporary alliances between “ordinary humans” and “ordinary machines”—a counter-hegemonic imagination that challenges the monopolization of creativity and agency by technological elites. This concept is being developed textually and will be tested through practice, as Yang seeks to confront the intensifying dynamics of digital colonialism and technological hegemony in the globalized present.

His practice spans a wide range of media—from installation and sculpture to interactive systems—reflecting a refusal to be confined by disciplinary boundaries. Beyond his artistic production, Yang has provided digital art services for leading institutions including Adidas International, the National Museum of China, Alibaba, and Cosmo magazine. In 2022, he became a contracted digital artist with Output. Currently, he directs R&C Design Studio, an experimental design practice exploring how generative AI intersects with material culture to reimagine the mechanisms of cultural heritage reproduction.

Currently focusing on transformed geographies of the fens, I investigate how land altered by human intervention becomes a site for both ecological tension and personal reflection. These shifting geographies operate as emotional cartographies—mapping grief, joy, loss, and resilience.

Through painting, I examine how systems of power and patriarchy have shaped both environment and identity. Reclaimed and eroded terrains offer metaphors for challenging structures of control, while also inviting more fluid, reciprocal ways of relating to place. My work proposes that ancient knowledge lingers in the land—in silty residues, ghost rivers, and unseen traces—waiting to be listened to rather than extracted.

Walking, writing, and sketching on-site inform a studio process driven by material curiosity. I work across media, layering, scraping back, and rebuilding, allowing the paintings to unfold intuitively. Embracing ambiguity and material agency, I seek to create contemplative spaces that resist resolution and invite attunement.
My research draws on object-oriented ontology, ecological theory, and feminist philosophy, with influences including Jane Bennett, Tim Morton, and Gilles Deleuze. I explore the Anthropocene not just as an environmental condition but as a psychological one, asking what becomes possible when we relinquish the need to dominate.

Bio:
I returned full-time to my practice in 2022 after a career in business. I hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Fine Art from the Royal College of Art (2024) and an MA in Fine Art from Falmouth University (2025), both awarded with distinction. Recently completing an MA in Painting at RCA, I was shortlisted for the 2025 Valerie Beston Award. I have exhibited in London and Cambridge, including a 2024 solo show at Safehouse 2, and my work is held in private collections.
",The Passage of Time I & II,10003,"Forgetting, Absence & Loss",tracy.mcbride@gmail.com,2025,Painting,"Oil, cold wax",Linen,"This diptych, The Passage of Time explores a semi-abstract landscape rendered in a restrained, monochromatic palette. The work draws on the language of gesture—scratches, brushstrokes, and scored marks—made through layers of oil paint and cold wax on linen. These surfaces record both presence and absence, the visible and the obscured, much like the land itself.

The composition evokes a terrain shaped by time and touch, altered by the persistent hand of human intervention. What once may have been open, fluid, and organic is now demarcated, controlled, or erased. Yet the painting resists moral judgement. Instead, it invites the viewer into a slowed, attentive mode of looking—one that mirrors the patience required in both landscape observation and the painterly process.

Here, the truth is not documentary but felt. It emerges through surface tension, through the act of making and unmaking, of concealing and revealing. The duality of the diptych reflects transformation: one panel perhaps more intact, the other more fragmented—suggesting a before and after, or a continual oscillation between states. This is a meditation on how land remembers, how marks linger, and how looking itself can be a radical, reparative act.

In doing so, she proposes softness as both aesthetic and critical strategy.",Love to fish,10000,Personal Archives & Family Memories,yudanding1990@outlook.com,2023,"Love and Relationship Dynamics,Gender,Symbolism and Biblical Imagery",Media: Illustration,Digital Prints,"What is true love and how to love a person? Jewish philosopher Abraham Twerski argued that the word “love” had lost its original meaning and was slowly being misunderstood. He told a very interesting story. Kotzk came across a young man who was eating fish, and he went over to him and asked, “why are you eating this fish?” The young man answered without thinking, “because I love fish！”Kotzk followed: “You love this fish, so you pull it out of the water, kill it and cook it. Come on, please don’t tell me you love this fish, it is yourself that you love because this fish tastes delicious.”
In my own experience of love, I am no different from the fish. The so-called “love” in a relationship is like the “love for fish”, which is based on certain qualities that he likes. But this love is also based on social rules that he should contribute more to the other as a partner. However, I myself feel like an imprisoned individual. My partner’s so-called “good for you” and “love you” are actually just to satisfy himself, expect you to change for him and become what he wants, which is actually a manifestation of his love for himself.
“People who like flowers will pick them to appreciate, and those who love flowers will water them silently.” There is a lot of love in the world, but most of it is “love for fish”.
In the project, I put my personal feelings and emotions into the picture as my reflection on the relationship between partners.
Most of the images in the picture take apples as inspirations. In the Bible story, apple is a forbidden fruit, representing pleasure and enjoyment, especially sexual pleasure. It has such a symbolic meaning, probably because its core is like the shape of female vulva. In Latin, apple is spelled the same way as “wrong”, both of which are “Malum”, so apple is a pun - Eve did wrong by eating the apple. The apple has always been a sort of conflicted symbol of love and lust.

In a time when tactile experience is increasingly blurred and the visualization of emotion is over-commodified, she transforms seemingly gentle acts of repetition—knitting, weaving, embroidery, and pattern-making—into mechanisms that respond to what she calls a “crisis of perception.”

She articulates a visual language of “ornamental energy shells”: protective yet intimate structures built from sequins, colors, and yarns. These patterned surfaces become sites of emotional projection, reflecting anxiety, memory, and the fragile bond between humans and nature. Through her work, the body is recalled as a sensory interface, while textiles emerge as tactile spiritual devices—tools for reconnection and resonance in an era of sensory decline.

Its luminous surfaces suggest a body in flux—part mineral, part organism— inhabiting a threshold state between technological artifact and imagined species. By merging silicone’s pliable resilience with the fragile tactility of textile, the piece generates an “energetic anatomy”: a speculative coil where softness becomes structural and ornamentation encodes vitality. The work proposes textile not only as surface or pattern, but as a system capable of simulating metabolic flow, magnetic resonance, and the poetics of nonhuman embodiment.

It explores how cultural totems, spiritual narratives, and everyday ornamentationintersect and regenerate within a space of multi-ethnic cohabitation.

Zorg conducted in-depth research in a diverse community where people of Asian, Arab, African, and European backgrounds live side by side, each with their own religious and cultural traditions. Some Asian residents practiceBuddhism; individuals of African heritage share stories connected to ancient Egyptian mythology; while many white residents follow Christian or Catholic faiths. The layering of beliefs and ethnicities forms a richly complex cultural landscape within the neighborhood.
Throughout his research, Zorg built relationships with local residents, listening closely to their stories and mythologies. He restructured these cross-cultural and spiritual narrativesinto a new visual form, inspiredby a symbolic window found within the community. The resulting work becomes not only a visual reconstruction of belief systems, but also a narrative space where multiple cultural voices are woven together and reimagined.

Employing the metaphor of the boulder from the Greek myth of Sisyphus, she reflects the cyclical struggles women face in breaking free from societal discipline, while further exploring how women reconstruct their identities and redefine notions of belonging and freedom amidst the tensions between tradition and modernity, society and the individual, and fiction and reality. Her methodology emphasizes dialogue and recognition: through interactions with the self, nature, and society, the artist achieves individual liberation and subjective reconfiguration. This practice not only responds to forces of domination and normalization but also embodies a relational politics grounded in interdependence and mutual recognition, proposing art as a critical intervention for reflecting upon and restructuring gendered social frameworks.",Sisyphus,10002,Mythic Narratives & Symbolic Rewriting,jingjingxu2000@outlook.com,2025,"Existentialism and Absurdism,Rebellion and Human Resilience,Myth Reinterpretation",Video,Digital,"Set within the philosophical framework of Camus’ absurdism, the myth of Sisyphus is reimagined here as a contemporary parable of “the absurd” and “rebellion.” The film turns its gaze toward this eternal cycle: the boulder rolls down, only to be pushed up again—transforming what appears to be a futile, repetitive action into a persistent inquiry into the meaning of existence.

Within this endless repetition, Sisyphus responds to the void through his very act, imbuing the absurd with meaning. The work is not merely a reenactment of myth, but seeks to mirror the existential predicament of the modern individual: amid the day-to-day labor and structural impasses, each of us pushes our own boulder. Here, “meaning” no longer resides in a distant endpoint, but is instead rooted in the continual struggle against the void—the ongoing, upward process itself.",,"https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251020/209b775de5d009f9de8327704fd7ac82.png?width=770&height=435,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251020/edc46a7d52d2cd1923144cd0a4d434f3.png?width=767&height=427,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251020/3515bd01c0030ffe99107f3ded982f67.png?width=1030&height=576,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251020/d2aea86b810712986b742e1084982d9d.png?width=1031&height=575,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251020/0f4c53e541ccbf7242b7767a11a6fbe0.png?width=1026&height=573",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhiB6ZcM6c,,jingjingxu2000@outlook.com,

So I tried to bring it back. My grandpa taught me how to hammer copper, using scraps from an old rice cooker and other broken appliances we had at home.

The project began when I chose to remove him from my life, channelling anger and the need for healing into my artistic process. Through this work, I aim to give form to the complex emotions that shaped my journey into adulthood.

The images were taken in natural settings to express my emotional connection to nature and to reflect on the historical relationship between women and the landscape. Once used by male artists to diminish women, this relationship has been reclaimed by contemporary female artists as a symbol of strength and liberation. For me, nature represents freedom from the domestic environment in which I was raised. If exhibited, I envision the work displayed in a domesticated space reminiscent of my home, creating a dialogue between the open, liberating quality of the natural world and the confined, toxic spaces of my past.

“Things are abstract in the non-visible, the transcendental goal of every path or journey. Individuals and phenomena dissolve through their own immediate existence.”
(Massimo Cacciari)*1

The monochromatic surfaces are built up through intense layering and sanding back of oil paint over time to create a sense of disintegration, irregularity, dissoloution and imperfection. These layers relate to the way in which layers are built up and worn down through the natural processes of time. This process also helps to create a sense of “Yugen” an Asian concept which means inexpressible depth or invisible beauty. This idea explores fleeting moments of awareness and sudden realisations of the transient nature of life which happen in the experience of “true reality”.                                              

This work arises from the study of Japanese aesthetic philosophy combined with research into of the place of spirituality in contemporary postmodern society and its influence on monochromatic painting.

These beings become living archives of human connection, embodying tensions between tenderness and fragmentation, self and other.

Before negative and misogynistic connotations were imposed upon it, gossip—from the Old English Godsibb, originally referring to a godparent—described companions during childbirth, trusted confidants, and close female friends. It conveyed strong emotional bonds and social ties among women in premodern English society.

The making of this vessel seeks to create an organic form representing the nourishment and protection of a woman's “gossip circle,” reclaiming its original meanings and subverting the degradation of female voices and gatherings enforced by patriarchy.

By coiling wire with wool yarn, the malleable wire encapsulates the flexibility and resilience of feminine strength, while the wool yarn signifies the collective warmth of countless caring hands.

The process was both intuitive and intentional, shaping a symbolic structure resembling a group of women holding a well together, from which a cosmic egg is born. It began with forming four inner circular structures representing female circles, then building the well beneath, followed by an outer layer symbolising radiant light and protection, and finally, the cosmic egg inside the well.

Rooted in place, craft, and community, the project partners with local knitters to revive regional resources and traditionally sustainable heritage techniques.

Seafolk responsibly harvests kelp to create fine fibres which can be spun into yarn. Dulse, a red macroalgae, is foraged for its soft pink pigment which is transformed into a dye. In this project, seaweed-based biomaterials bring together local knitters to honour the heritage of the Cornish gansey (a traditional fisherman’s jumper), integrating regenerative and circular design ideas into traditional local practices. 

The ganseys are seen as a symbol of identity, with every pattern specific to a place. According to folklore this enabled a lost fishermen to be identified. The 'Gwiadores' jumper is a collaboratively knitted piece, where each knitter created a wool patch in their local pattern. These were then stitched together with a seaweed based yarn and dyed pink with seaweed. 

Through conversations with local knitters, the strength of the seaweed yarn became apparent, and its suitability to reinforce areas of the jumper which receive more wear and tear was identified. Echoing the ganseys traditionally sustainable design, the seaweed thread was therefore used to reinforce an elbow patch.  

Fast-growing and carbon sequestering, seaweed requires no fresh water or arable land and supports rich underwater ecosystems. It’s an incredibly regenerative, renewable, and local resource, which plays a vital role in supporting marine biodiversity and strengthening climate resilience. 

By returning to traditional techniques and my local heritage through innovative biomaterials, Seafolk creates a dialogue between past and future. It invites the industry and consumers to rethink traditional materiality and presents a material future rooted in history, craft, community, local resources and life cycle.

She holds an MA in Painting from the Royal College of Art and a BFA in Textiles from the Alberta University of the Arts (formerly ACAD). After graduating from the RCA, she joined the Turps Studio Programme to continue growing her painting practice in the UK.
Daisy’s work moves between memory, landscape, and imagination. Through semi-abstract painting, she explores feelings of space and absence, resilience and hope. Her landscapes often become a way to navigate her own multi-cultural identity and to find balance within the layered sense of belonging that comes from living between cultures.
Material plays an important part in her process. She experiments with plant dyes, ground pigments, and organic materials to build the surface of each painting, using these natural elements as a way to connect her inner world with the environment around her.
Her time living and studying in Japan, Mexico, and the UK has deeply shaped her perspective. These experiences have inspired her to explore how different cultures understand the relationship between humans and the natural world. Through her work, Daisy hopes to create a quiet dialogue between Eastern and Western sensibilities—reflecting ideas of cyclical time, memory, and place.
While at the RCA, Daisy took part in several exhibitions that highlighted her experiments with plant-based pigments and weaving. She has also been invited to speak at the RCA’s Temporal Material seminar, where she shares her ongoing research into traditional Japanese dyeing methods.

The divided composition evokes a landscape in cross-section — a place where memory, matter, and time gather in layered sediments. Subtle gradations of light and texture suggest both erosion and revelation, as if something long buried briefly rises to view. This tension between decay and renewal mirrors an inner act of introspection: looking beneath appearances to uncover what endures. Through its quiet interplay of opacity and transparency, the work invites contemplation of the unseen forces that shape both the natural world and the self.

Drawing from a tranquil pond in Canada, the artist began with on-site sketches, later tracing their fluid forms onto translucent paper layered with oil paint. Pressed against the canvas, the painted surfaces leave tactile impressions — traces of contact and memory.

Minglu Du is a queer interdisciplinary artist based between Providence, USA, and Shanghai, China. Her practice spans illustration, experimental animation, games, and installation, often integrating literature and sound to create immersive, narrative-driven experiences. She frequently depicts human figures as metaphorical or surreal creatures, reflecting on social inequalities through thick, twisted forms, sharp color contrasts, and metallic textures that evoke visceral emotion.

Her work combines surreal visual language and storytelling to invite viewers into the psychological and emotional worlds of her characters. Through explorations of trauma, resilience, and empathy, she focuses on the lived realities of marginalized and diasporic communities, revealing the fragility and complexity of human relationships and social dynamics, and creating visual experiences that embody tenderness, vulnerability, and strength.", Apollo and Daphne,10002,Mythic Narratives & Symbolic Rewriting,minglu.du98@gmail.com,2023,"animation,video,stop-motion animation",Stop-motion animation,"clay,paper,flashlight","Apollo and Daphne is a clay-and-paper stop-motion animation that re-examines a canonical myth by revealing what is often obscured within its familiar telling.

Daphne’s transformation is rendered not as transcendence but as an act of desperate self-protection, an escape that exposes the violence inherent in patriarchal desire.

With a focus on illness, social stigma, and emotional expression, his work transforms research-based interviews into poetic visual forms—ranging from publications and installations to interactive print experiments.

Coming from a non-traditional art background, Wang approaches visual storytelling with both emotional intuition and analytical depth. His recent work investigates how diseases like HIV and depression are metaphorically represented and socially silenced. Through participant-led archives and materials like thermosensitive ink, he invites audiences to engage not only visually, but physically—with stories that are often unheard or unseen.

Wang’s artistic language draws from the raw expressiveness of graphic novels and the cultural undercurrents of subversion. His practice lies between illustration, publishing, and critical social inquiry, aiming to create visual work that is both intimate and reflective.

The work consists of three archival folders coated with heat-sensitive ink. When touched, the warmth of the viewer’s hands reveals hidden words beneath the surface. Each folder preserves the stories of those marginalized by disease. They are obscured by fear and moral narratives.

The work transforms touch into an ‘encounter’. Its interactivity depends not on technology, but on care and courage. The work does not only speak on behalf of other but also it creates a space where others can be heard. The viewer’s hand becomes the medium in this work. Only when people touch the surface of folders, the stories emerge. Here, empathy is not merely a concept, but a practice.

Rejecting dramatization, Wang adopts the position of a listener. With a restrained, documentary tone, he records and shares these voices. Through this modest archival system, he reminds us that real empathy is not pity but the courage to approach and to listen. Understanding begins when people are willing to approach.

Across clay, installation and painting, I aim to interrogate hegemonic messages of current day social justice, exposing the scorched earth of cultural erasure, the iron grip of totalitarianism and the unraveling dominance of complicit silence. 
Wondering across seven nations in my formative years, I absorbed a kaleidoscope of suppressed histories and cultures - a profound privilege that shattered parochial veils. These visceral encounters ignited me to pierce through noise and propose unflinching dialogues; illuminating the shadows where humanism devours itself and the unconscious is puppeteered into submission.

Its gaze is accusatory, a silent indictment of anthropocentric hubris. Nature here is not pastoral; it is a sovereign force that nurtures only to devour, its lightning-strikes as arbitrary and absolute as divine wrath. 

 This ambivalence is deliberate: the artwork refuses the sentimental ecology that frames wildfire solely as catastrophe. Instead it gives insights to the ancient role of fire as both destroyer and renewer—an ontology Indigenous fire stewards have long understood.

At its core, the work stages a confrontation: a laser-cut deer-god—its antlers fractured into crimson red—emerges from acrylic board structure, the paint layering a visceral autopsy of the forest’s own flesh.

Beneath the mythic register lies a lacerating political critique. In Canada, Indigenous communities—custodians of cultural burning practices that once modulated ecosystems—are abandoned and neglected. The government’s refusal to protect these territories is not mere oversight; it is a continuation of erasure, a slow incineration of sovereignty. The red forest, then, is both literal and metaphorical: a landscape ablaze and a body politic cauterized by indifference.

Through this diptych of creation and critique, “Wrath of the Red Forest” demands a reckoning. It asks whether we can bear to look at nature’s ferocity without flinching, and whether a nation can confront its own complicity in the ashes it pretends not to see.

Historical overexploitation and exploitation of natural resources has often been accompanied by exploitation of labour and the environment . The quarrying of Portland Stone reconfigured the interactions between power, wealth, and land, embodying the wealth and authority brought about by colonization.
My project primarily explores the exploitation and power dynamics hidden behind limestone. It satirizes the dichotomy between the deprivation and acquisition of power during the colonial era, encouraging viewers to reconsider social identity and the politics of geological materials within a postcolonial context. Additionally, the project employs theatrical exaggeration to reveal conflicts, guiding audiences to deeply reflect on heritage and contemporary social mechanisms and examining the relationship between power structures and individual and collective identities in modern society.
Through a mechanical sculpture, the project investigates the geological and historical tensions involved in the “extraction” and “governance” of London Stone, a limestone quarried on Portland Island in the 17th century. After the catastrophic fire of 1666, the ruling class in Britain mined Portland stone to rebuild St. Paul’s Cathedral and construct symbols of authority in London. Ironically, today, Portland stone preserves the only survivor of that fire—London Stone—Ruling class at that time would hit the stone to get Power of Autonomy.

Humans often measure life using hours, minutes, seconds, years, months, and days, asserting that all creatures should conform to these temporal norms—an anthropocentric arrogance. Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi (275 B.C.) challenged this view, promoting 'levelling all things (齐物论)' to foster a non-anthropocentric ethic. In his essay 'A happy excursion (逍遥游),' Zhuangzi bases his discussion on the perception of time by living beings: 'The morning mushroom knows nothing of the noontide; the winter cicada knows nothing of the spring and autumn.' '… In ancient times, there was even one massive tree whose spring and autumn were each eight thousand years long,' highlighting 'equality' in how all things perceive time.
When I use a camera to capture the passage of time in natural organisms, there is an inevitable sense of intrusion—an imprint of human technology upon nature. This intrusion carries an implicit hierarchy, a gaze of superiority and scrutiny. In response, I turn to the ancient Van Dyke development technique, seeking a way to render time within natural forms. Insects, plants, animals, stones—these objects are placed on paper coated with Van Dyke solution, allowing light and chemistry to inscribe their presence.

His undergraduate studies in interior design cultivated his keen observation of architectural space and internal structure. While drawing, he started to get in touch with the camera and gradually tried to visualize his expression through the language of photography.

His image style is deeply influenced by Japanese ‘Conpora’ photography, which is a simple and direct way to record things in the scope of people's daily life. These images, captured by pressing the shutter without overthinking, reflect his innermost emotions and his feelings towards the outside world. By learning the techniques of the darkroom, he was able to rethink his relationship with the image while making the photographs, and in the process exploring and building his own photographic narrative.

Originally from Baku, Azerbaijan, her practice centers on the translation of memory, emotion, and cultural history into contemporary visual and material forms. Working across publication design, tactile archiving, interactive objects, and digital experimentation, Medina explores how personal and collective histories can be reshaped through design.
Her work often takes the form of critical re-readings of existing systems, whether typographic archives, live performances, or museum classifications, to challenge how narratives are constructed, preserved, and inherited. Through methods like visual compression, sensory distortion, and material transformation, she designs tools and artefacts that make emotional or historical moments tangible and re-experiencable.
Recent projects include Methods of Translating, a visual and material archive of Aretha Franklin’s 2015 Kennedy Center Honors performance, where Medina translates the emotional language of song into engraved acrylic discs, digital line art, and layered audio experiments. This project reflects a broader recurring thread in her work: treating design as an act of cultural translation, where the past is not simply preserved but actively reshaped and returned to the present.
Medina’s practice builds on her background in editorial design and physical computing, having previously developed interactive works such as the Emotional Processor and Coping Blocks. Her work is driven by the belief that emotional and cultural legacies must be handled critically but also tenderly, occupying a space between research, making, and storytelling.

Methods of Translating is a cross-media translation and archival reimagining of Aretha Franklin’s 2015 Kennedy Center Honors performance of “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.” By drawing from a moment deeply embedded in collective cultural memory, the project interrogates how emotional resonance survives when a performance is removed from the immediacy of live experience.
The original performance, available here:
Aretha Franklin - “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” (YouTube)
In this project, the performance becomes a site of translation, visually, materially, and emotionally. Through a methodical process of digital reduction, live footage is abstracted into engraved-like line art, each piece capturing a specific emotional moment. These line-based visuals are then translated into engraved acrylic discs, arranged in sequence to form a tactile archive. These objects merge personal memory with material reinvention.
Each disc corresponds to a key timestamp from the performance: The Stage Entrance, The First Note, The Coat Drop, The Crescendo, Carole King’s Reaction. These function as emotional markers within the archive. 
The project acts as both preservation and reinvention, treating translation as an act of return. It asks how we revisit and re-feel collective histories, how emotional heritage survives through reinterpretation, and what is lost and gained when we transform the past through contemporary design.",12 cm x 12 cm,"https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251117/e05810fc412bb20ac33d2b5ce87f0c7d.jpg?width=6000&height=4000,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251118/7c7fdca327d0ce51f4d4f3aceb58ac94.jpg?width=4032&height=3024,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251117/43f86a48b08f1dd7abd2560a9952b225.jpg?width=6000&height=4000,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251118/365c6496933386cd892ad9579178fec6.jpg?width=6000&height=4000,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251118/51b6ab94dd6299d7ee348e7864727cb3.jpg?width=6000&height=4000",,https://to-gather.oss-us-east-1.aliyuncs.com/prod/art-forum/pic/20251118/eb9b4b3a673f1d5ee4751eeaa0d53bd6.jpg?width=3014&height=2259,medina.mammadkhanova@gmail.com,"Medina Mammadkhanova

His practice integrates image-making, material exploration, and structural construction to reflect the unstable boundary between being seen and being overlooked.

It focuses on the synesthetic perception of color, aiming to create emotional and bodily responses through multisensory textile design.

Through researching psychological, cultural, and sensory associations of natural colors, I will build a “color–scent–touch” mapping system. Materials such as silk, cotton, paper yarn, and wool will be used to translate each color into a unique sensory combination—expressing its emotional tone, texture, and temperature. The outcome will be a multisensory color coding system applicable to textile design.

The project responds to contemporary interests in experiential design, sensory diversity, and nature-based materials. Final outcomes will include a sensory swatch book, emotional textiles, and color installations—suitable for exhibitions, therapy spaces, and educational tools—redefining how we perceive and connect with color through textiles.

I work with voice recordings, personal archives and my own mirror image to explore making as a haptic and open ended negotiation. Using auto ethnographic methods, I incorporate the voices of my mother, myself and my grown-up children to engage with transgenerational listening and emotional inheritance. Rooted in phenomenology and post aesthetic thinking, my work repositions the self as a constellation of shared experiences that are partial, relational and in constant transformation.","Mo Mháthair Ériu (My Mother, Ériu)",10000,Personal Archives & Family Memories,maebhmartin13@gmail.com,2025,Fine Art ,Print making ,Xerox/laser print ,"Mo Mháthair, Ériu began as a self-portrait drawn in marker while listening to recordings of my mother reciting poetry in the final months of her life. The raw, child-like lines echo the rhythm of her voice and the memory of her reading Irish fables and stories of Irish warrior queens to us as children. These vocal traces became a way to return, to culture, mythology, and matriarchal histories, while also moving forward through the act of drawing.
Inspired by David Hockney’s Xerox works and their playful questioning of whether a copy can become an original, I developed the laser-print drawing. By layering, rotating, and superimposing the autoethnographic portrait with scans of paint experiments also made while listening to my mother, exploring how reproduction can generate new presence.The print becomes a site where memory, gesture, and voice recombine, an event rather than an image resonating with Heidegger’s notion of art as a mode of being. It explores how returns, to voice, to myth, to the maternal open pathways toward the future as I navigate grief and my own creativity .
The title, Mo Mháthair, Ériu (My Mother, Ériu), invokes the Irish mythical mother-figure who embodies the land itself. The portrait becomes a transtemporal meeting point, an echo and a return, where personal memory entwines with cultural mythology, continually reshaping itself in the present.

Inspired by architectural forms, textile motifs, and ritual design traditions of the region, the work constructs an empire whose visual language is both ancient and futurist. Within this world, fox demigods, elite floating hammams, and ornate winged machines exist as curated remnants of a manipulated past.

Set against this backdrop, the story follows a young rebel from the abandoned poor fox tribes, who steals a sacred fruit and inadvertently awakens the wrath of the god once responsible for dividing her people. Her act becomes a catalyst for confronting the myths upheld by the elites, revealing buried histories and challenging the narratives that shaped the world’s hierarchies. As she journeys across scorched badlands and sacred ruins, she seeks not only survival, but the possibility of returning life to the dying desert.

The piece examines how history is selectively preserved by those in power, contrasting the glorified narratives of the ruling class with the suppressed memories of the oppressed. By merging North African inspired cultural codes with contemporary digital painting, Fallen Sky positions world building as a form of archival practice; one that bridges folklore, cultural inheritance, and speculative futurism.

Through this interplay of myth, story, and reconstruction, the work reflects on how societies continually reshape their past.

As someone whose identity is not always consistent and often marginalized by mainstream socio-political narratives, I'm drawn to themes and fragments that channel ""a presence of the absence"", or a ""hauntology"" of my personal life.

Echolalia—often defined as the seemingly meaningless repetition of words spoken by infants—resonates deeply with my own linguistic journey: each time a native speaker corrected my pronunciation, I internalized and recalibrated the “proper” sound, layering new forms of speech over earlier ones. Drawing on Daniel Heller-Roazen’s insight that language acquisition hinges on “a kind of linguistic infantile amnesia,” quoting his Echolalias: On the forgetting of language (2008, 11), I consider this work an exploration of how becoming a “native speaker” requires both remembering and forgetting, both echoing and overwriting.

Writing poems can feel intimidating for a second-language speaker, so I turned to found poetry as a way of reconstructing meaning from what already exists. I sourced phrases from used books on critical theory, environmental science and art—texts written in a kind of “public language.” Through cutting, rearranging, and recontextualizing their words, I transform these authoritative voices into something more intimate: a provisional, personal language that emerges through repetition and fragmentation.

Each clipped word or phrase is steeped in oil, rendering the paper translucent so that the text on both sides seeps through. This creates a palimpsestic field where front and back echo one another. Verses are no longer contained by a single page or a fixed orientation; instead, meanings return unexpectedly when pages are overlaid, reversed, or read through. What appears is a haunting interplay of legible and illegible layers—a re-emergence of echoes that were once lost.

In this way, this zine situates language not as a stable repository of meaning, but as something that continuously haunts, repeats, and remakes itself.

The work seeks to evoke ‘melting’ between experiential and material reality—using distorted sound, layered image, and spoken word to dissolve ideological boundaries between self and environment. I am a collage of all that precedes me; these skin borders cannot contain me; I am large, I contain multitudes.

The piece draws from three deeply intimate archival strata.
First, footage from my parents’ wedding is intercut with fragments from completed and abandoned short films, forming an inherited visual DNA that bleeds into my own creative attempts.

Second, my camera roll—detachable hippocampus. Much of this digital hoard has vanished beyond this film: a failure to upload to any Cloud, and reminder that my techno-limbs are as losable as memory itself. These flickering images warp the layers beneath, pulling the viewer into a near-hypnotic attempt to see through the noise. This fragmentation reflects not only how coherence is strained under algorithmic media onslaught, but how we reproduce this distortion in our personal archives. Upon owning the tools to manufacture media, the boundary between the self and the media produced evaporated.

Third, diary entries written while ‘coming to’—from consumer-comfort-centric simulacrum to a deeper critique of capitalist individualism shaped through white supremacy. As I grappled with Descartes’ legacy of severing thought from matter, I recognised the profound loneliness shaping my life was not personal failure but systemic design. My writings grieve a self who watched their life on an internal television, striving to reunite soul with matter, and reach for solidarity in a system that profits from isolation.

The collage culminates in two soundscapes: an unsettling static that repels the viewer, followed by slow, elegiac chords that pull them back—inviting them to confront their own estrangement and unravel with me.
